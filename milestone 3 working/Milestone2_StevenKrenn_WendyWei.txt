DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLES 

[0023] FIG. 1 schematically illustrates an example grain quality monitoring system 20. As will be described hereafter, system 20 accurately estimates or determines the quality of bulk grain. System 20 comprises bulk grain image source 24, processor 28, controller 32, display 36 and memory 40. Bulk grain image source comprises one or more devices configured to capture at least one image of bulk grain for analysis by system 20 in determining quality of the grain. In one implementation, "bulk grain" refers to a mass of harvested product which when clean includes only grain of the particular intended crop being harvested, but which, when not clean, additionally includes some of broken grain, skinned grain, unthreshed grain of the intended crop, grain of unintended plants such as weeds or volunteer plants, and/or other non-grain elements such as chaff, hulls, sticks, stock, cobs, stems, pods, dirt or other foreign contaminants. In one implementation, a camera, such as an optical camera or an infrared camera, captures at least one image of bulk grain. 

[0024] In one implementation, bulk grain image source 24 comprises a camera mounted or supported by a piece of grain harvesting equipment, such as a harvester. For example, in one implementation, bulk grain image source 24 comprises a camera mounted along a grain elevator of a harvester and/or a camera mounted along the tailings elevator of a harvester. In another implementation, bulk grain image source 24 comprises a camera mounted along a grain tank of a harvester. In yet another implementation, bulk grain image source 24 is mounted at other locations of a harvester along which harvested grain is conveyed or gathers. 

[0025] In yet other implementations, bulk grain image source 24 comprises a camera mounted or supported to capture images of bulk grain at other locations where bulk grain is conveyed or collected. For example, in one implementation, bulk grain image source 24 comprises a camera mounted along an elevator or conveyor, or along an internal grain collecting volume or tank, of a grain transport vehicle, a grain bin or other grain aggregation location. Bulk grain image source 24 outputs signals representing the image which are received by processor 28. 

[0026] Processor 28 comprises at least one processing unit configured to analyze the bulk grain images received from source 24 and to provide output based upon such analysis. For purposes of this application, the term "processing unit" shall mean a presently developed or future developed processing unit that executes sequences of instructions contained in a memory. Execution of the sequences of instructions causes the processing unit to perform steps such as generating control signals. The instructions may be loaded in a random access memory (RAM) for execution by the processing unit from a read only memory (ROM), a mass storage device, or some other persistent storage. In other embodiments, hard wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the functions described. For example, in other implementations, processor 28 is embodied as part of one or more application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Unless otherwise specifically noted, the controller is not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software, nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the processing unit. 

[0027] Controller 32 comprises one or more processing units configured to output control signals directing the operation of a piece of grain handling equipment. For example, in one implementation, controller 32 outputs control signals that control and adjust operational parameters of a piece of harvesting equipment. In one implementation, controller 32 controls one or more operational parameters of a combine harvester. For example, controller 32 outputs control signals adjusting concave spacing, conveyor speed and/or fan speed of a combine harvester. In another implementation, controller 32 controls one or more operational parameters of a grain conveying system, wherein grain selectively conveyed to one of a plurality of different available locations or operations in response to signals from controller 32. For example, depending upon the quality level of grain as indicated by system 20, controller 32 selectively turns on and off different conveyors to convey grain to different locations such as to different grain screening or filtering operations or different grain use destinations. 

[0028] Display 36 comprises one or more devices by which information regarding the quality of grain is visibly displayed. For example, in one implementation, display 36 comprises a series of light emitting diodes that provide alerts or notifications regarding grain quality. In another implementation, display 36 comprises a display screen, such as a touch screen. In one implementation, display 36 additionally comprises speakers or other auditory devices by which information is communicated. In one implementation, display 36 is provided in the cab of a piece of harvesting equipment to indicate grain quality to an operator during the harvest of grain. In another implementation, display 36 is provided remote from the harvester, such as when the harvest is remotely controlled or such as when grain quality is being reviewed by a remote manager. 

[0029] Memory 40 comprises a non-transitory computer-readable medium containing program logic, in the form of code, software, circuitry or instructions, which direct the operation of processor 28. Memory 40 additionally serves as a persistent storage device by which data is stored. Although memory 40 is illustrated as a single memory, in other implementations, memory 40 is distributed amongst multiple memory devices or memory locations, such as across a local area network or a wide area network. In the example illustrated, memory 40 comprises software modules which carry out analysis of grain quality and which provide for direct output based upon the results of such analysis. In the example illustrated, memory 40 comprises image capture module 48 feature module 50, classification module 54, quality determination module 56, data storage portion 58 and output module 62. 

[0030] Image capture module 48, feature module 50, classification module 54, quality determination module 56, data storage portion 58 and output module 62 each comprises program logic to direct processor 28 in the implementation of method 100 outlined in FIG. 2. As indicated by block 102 of FIG. 2, image capture module 48 directs processor 28 to receive or otherwise acquire an image of bulk grain from bulk grain image source 24. In one implementation, image capture module 48 directs processor 28 to carry out one or more processes upon the image of bulk grain received from source 24 to enhance image quality. In one implementation, image capture module 48 further directs processor 28 to output control signals controlling bulk grain image source 24 in the capture of an image of bulk grain. 

[0031] As indicated by block 104 in FIG. 2, feature module 50 directs processor 28 to apply a feature extractor to and across the bulk grain image to extract or compute a feature of the bulk grain generally across the image, irrespective of any particulate boundaries or grain boundaries in the image, so as to identify variations in the feature across the area of the bulk grain image. A feature of the bulk grain image is a characteristic or aspect of the bulk grain image. As will be described hereafter, in some implementations, one or more feature extractors may be additionally applied to segments, based upon particular identified boundaries or grain boundaries, of the bulk grain image. 

[0032] FIG. 3A illustrates an example bulk grain image 120. As shown by FIG. 3A, the bulk grain image 120 comprises a two dimensional image made up of a two-dimensional array of image pixels. In the example illustrated, a pixel is a smallest addressable element. Each bulk grain image pixel has an associated set of characteristics or features based upon the original bulk grain from which the image was captured. 

[0033] As shown by FIGS. 3B-3E, the application of various example feature extractors to bulk grain image 120 produces feature images 122, 124, 126 and 130. Each feature image 122, 124, 126 and 130 is based upon the original bulk grain image 120 except that a selected image feature associated with each pixel is separated or filtered out from remaining features associated with each pixel. The feature that is filtered out by the filter or feature extractor will have different values at different locations or pixels across the feature image 122, 124, 126 and 130. Such values may vary on a pixel by pixel basis or groups of adjacent pixels may have the same value for the particular feature. 

[0034] In the example illustrated, FIG. 3B illustrates application of a color filter to the image of FIG. 3A to form feature image 122. FIG. 3C illustrates application of a different color filter to the image of FIG. 3A to form feature image 124. FIG. 3D illustrates application of an intensity filter at a larger scale to the image of FIG. 3A to form feature image 126. FIG. 3E illustrates application of a discrete cosine transform filter, to the image of FIG. 3A to form feature image 130. Examples of feature extractors include, but are not limited to, intensity/color filters at various scales, intensity/color variation at various scales, edge detectors, corner detectors, Haar filters, Gabor filters, wavelet filters, discrete cosine transform, fast Fourier transform, texture filters, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), keypoint descriptors, and convolutions with sets of filter banks. In one implementation, feature module 50 directs processor 28 to apply multiple feature extractors to extract multiple features or stacks of features of the bulk grain in the bulk grain image. 

[0035] As indicated by block 106 of FIG. 2, classification module 54 directs processor 28 to sample values for at least one feature at different selected or sampled locations of the bulk grain image. In the example illustrated, FIG. 3A illustrates five example sampling locations 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D and 132E. In one implementation, the sampling locations, for which the values for at least one feature are sampled, are randomly chosen by classification module 54. In one implementation, the random selection of sampling locations by classification module 54 is unconstrained. In another implementation, the selection of sampling locations by classification module 54 is in accordance with one or more predefined constraints or restrictions. For example, in one implementation, the sampling locations are randomly chosen so long as the chosen sampling locations satisfy predefined distribution across the bulk grain image sample. In one implementation, the sampling locations are randomly chosen so long as the chosen sampling locations have a minimum spacing from one another, have a maximum spacing from one another or are within a predefined range of spacings from one another. In another implementation, the sampling locations are randomly chosen, but wherein each zone or portion of the bulk grain image, such as each quadrant, contain a predefined minimum number of sampling locations or contain no greater than a predefined maximum number of sampling locations. 

[0036] In another implementation, the sampling locations are predefined or preselected by classification module 54. For example, in one implementation, classification module 54 directs processor 28 to analyze values for at least one feature at predefined sampling locations according to a predefined pattern of locations. For example, in one implementation, classification module 54 extracts and analyzes values for at least one feature from every other pixel of bulk grain image 120, from every fourth pixel of bulk grain image 120 or the like. Given sufficient computing capability, such as speed, in one implementation, classification module 54 directs processor 28 to analyze values for at least one feature from each and every pixel of bulk grain image 120. However, to reduce processing load and processing time for analyzing grain quality, classification module 54 directs processor 28 to extract and utilize values for at least one feature from only selected sampling locations or pixels, or a portion of the total number of pixels, of bulk grain image 120. 

[0037] At each of sampling locations 132, classification module 54 directs processor 28 to determine, based upon the value for the feature at the sampling location or based upon the value for each of the features at the sampling location, a classification score. Classification module 54 takes a feature or set of features as an input and produces a classification score as an output that represents how likely those input features are to belong to a class of interest. For example, in one implementation, classification module 54 directs processor 28 to determine a classification score for the presence of a particular classification, such as mass other than grain (MOG), at the particular sampling location 132A. In one implementation, the determination of the probability for the presence of a particular classification, such as MOG, at the particular sampling location 132A is determined based upon the value for a single feature at sampling location 132A. For example, in one implementation, classification module 54 determines the classification score for the presence of MOG sampling location 132A is based upon the value for the feature at the corresponding sampling location 132A in one of feature image 122, feature image 124, feature image 126, feature image 130, or a different feature image of extracted feature values for a different particular feature. In another implementation, classification module 54 determines a classification score for the presence of MOG at the particular sampling location 132A based upon the value of each of multiple features at sampling location 132A. For example, in one implementation, classification module 54 determines a classification score for the presence of MOG at the particular sampling location 132 based upon the value for a first feature at the corresponding sampling location 132A in feature image 122 and additionally based upon the value for a second feature at the corresponding sampling location 132A in feature image 124. In yet other implementations, the classification score for the presence of a particular classification at a particular sampling location is based upon the value for more than two features at the particular sampling location. 

[0038] As further shown by FIG. 3A, classification module 54 directs processor 28 to determine a classification score, as described above, for a particular classification at each of a multitude of different sampling locations. For example, classification module 54 (1) determines a first classification score for the presence of a particular material classification, such as MOG, at sampling location 132A, (2) determines a second classification score for the presence of the same particular material classification, such as MOG at sampling location 132B, (3) determines a third classification score for the presence of the same particular classification, such as MOG at sampling location 132C, and so on for each sampling location. Although FIG. 3A illustrates five sampling locations 132, in other implementations, classification module 54 may determine a classification score at a greater or lesser number of such sampling locations. 

[0039] In one implementation, classification module 54 directs processor 28 to determine a classification score for each of multiple different material classifications at each sampling location 132. For example, in one implementation, classification module 54 assigns each sampling location a classification score for each of a plurality of different classifications. In the example illustrated, the classification score comprises a probability value. For example, classification module 54 may assign the sampling location a probability of x % that the image sample is depicting a first classification of material and a probability of z % that the sampling location is depicting a second classification of material and so on, wherein the sum of the probabilities does not exceed 100%. For example, in one implementation, classification model 54 directs processor 28 to determine a probability for the presence of a first material classification, such as broken grain, at a sampling location as well as a probability for the presence of a second different material classification, such as MOG, MOG heavy or MOG light, at the same sampling location. In other implementations, the classification score determined by classification module 54 comprises a likelihood, a percentage, a distance from a decision surface, a binary output, an output from an artificial neural network, an output from a deep convolutional neural network, or any of many other classifier output values. 

[0040] In one implementation, each sampling location comprises an individual pixel, the smallest addressable unit, of the bulk grain image 120, wherein the value for a feature of the individual pixel of the bulk grain image or wherein the value of each feature of a set of features of the individual pixel of the bulk grain image is used to determine a probability for the presence of a particular material classification at the individual pixel serving as the sampling location. 

[0041] In other implementations, the sampling location alternatively comprises a predefined set of pixels, wherein the value for a feature of each of the individual pixels of the set or wherein value of each feature of a set of features of each of the individual pixels of the set are collectively used to determine a probability for the presence of a particular material classification at the sampling location. For example, in one implementation, a sampling location is defined as a set of four adjacent pixels, wherein each of the four values for one feature from the four adjacent pixels is used to define a probability for the presence of a particular grain or harvested product classification at the sampling location. For example, in one implementation, a median, average, largest observation, smallest observation or other statistical value derived from the four values for the one feature from the four adjacent pixels is used to determine the probability for the presence of a particular material classification at the sampling location. In another implementation, a median, average, largest observation, smallest observation or other statistical value derived from the four values from the four adjacent pixels for each of a plurality of features is used to determine the probability for the presence of a particular material classification at the sampling location. 

[0042] In one implementation, classification module 54 determines a probability for the presence of a particular classification at a sampling location by consulting a predetermined lookup table containing different values for different features and different probabilities for different classifications of materials corresponding to the different values for the different features. In one implementation, probability entries in the lookup table are generated by taking multiple grain samples, capturing an image of each of the multiple grain samples, applying a feature extractor to each of the images to extract a feature in each of the images, measuring the feature in each of the images to determine a value for the feature, and determining the actual composition or classification of the material in the grain sample by labeling the image of the grain sample or by sifting or filtering through each of the actual grain samples. Based upon data acquired from such a process carried out on multiple grain samples, probabilities that particular feature values correspond to a particular classification of material are identified to populate the lookup table. 

[0043] In another implementation, classification module 54 applies one or more algorithms to the value for the extracted feature, or to values for multiple extracted features, to determine a probability that the image sample corresponds to a classification of material. In such an implementation, the one or more algorithms are created in a fashion similar to the above process used to populate the above-described lookup table. In particular, a mathematical relationship between different values for an extracted feature, or for multiple extracted features of an image sample and a probability that the image sample is depicting a particular classification of material is determined by taking multiple grain samples, capturing an image of each of the multiple grain samples, applying a filter to each of the images to extract a feature in each of the images, measuring the feature in each of the images to determine a value for the feature, and determining the actual composition or classification of the material in the grain sample by labeling the image of the grain sample or by sifting or filtering through each of the actual grain samples. 

[0044] In the example illustrated, classification module 54 is operable in one of various modes selectable by a user of system 20, wherein system 20 analyzes bulk grain for different classifications of material. For example, in one mode of operation, classification system 20 analyzes bulk grain for a single classification of material. In another mode of operation, system 20 analyzes bulk grain for each of multiple different classifications of material selected by the user of system 20. Examples of different classifications of material for which classification module 54 makes a prediction with regard to each individual image sample include, but are not limited to, one or more of: one or more ranges regarding material other than grain (MOG), such as MOG light, MOG heavy or other more specific classifications of material such as hull, broken, sticks, stock, cobs, stems, pods, unthreshed grain, skinned grain, and clean grain. In other implementations, classification module 54 may predict other classifications of material depending upon a particular grain type and the particular plant from which the grain is harvested. 

[0045] As indicated by block 108 in FIG. 2, quality determination module 56 directs processor 28 in the determination of grain quality of grain represented by the bulk grain image received from the bulk grain image source 24. Quality determination module 56 converts sampling location probabilities into an overall estimate of the grain quality, including estimates of the amount of each material classification of interest. Quality determination module 56 determines and outputs a signal or signals indicating quality of grain for the bulk grain image based upon an aggregate of the probabilities of the different sampling locations, for the particular material classification. In one implementation, quality determination module 56 performs a statistical operation on the probabilities, wherein the resulting value from the statistical operation is used to output a value indicating what percentage of the material depicted in the bulk grain image 120 is a particular material classification or values indicating what percent of the material depicted in the bulk grain image is a first material classification, what percent of the material depicted in the bulk grain image is a second material classification and so on. For example, in one scenario, quality determination module 56 may output a value indicating that 70% of the material depicted in the bulk grain image 120 constitutes clean grain, 20% of the material depicted in the bulk grain image constitutes broken grain and 10% of the material depicted in the bulk grain image constitutes MOG. In one implementation, quality determination module 56 sums and averages the probabilities for each class or classification of material over all of the sampling locations in the image to determine what percentage of the material depicted in the bulk grain image constitutes a particular classification of material 

[0046] In one implementation, quality determination module further applies a calibration function to the results to produce an estimate of percent mass for the particular classification of material and/or a percent mass for clean grain. In one implementation, quality determination model 56 further applies time filters to the results over multiple bulk grain images 120, such as applying a simple weighted moving window filter. In one implementation, quality module 56 further accounts for image overlap in the time filter. In another implementation, the quality determination module 56 applies a weighted filter based on amount of material presented to the bulk grain image source 24, as opposed to being based on time. 

[0047] Referring once again to FIG. 1, data storage 58 comprises one portion of memory 40 that stores the results of the grain quality diagnosis/analysis performed by system 20. In one implementation, data storage 58 additionally stores any databases or data tables used by feature module 50, classification module 54 and quality determination module 56. As noted above, in some implementations, data storage 58 is carried by a piece of harvesting equipment, such as the combine harvester. In other implementations, data storage 58 comprises a database remote from processor 28 and/or bulk grain image source 24, wherein results are transmitted to data storage 58 across a wired or wireless local area network or wide area network. 

[0048] Output module 62 comprises program logic contained in memory 40 for directing processor 28 to utilize the results of the grain quality diagnosis/analysis. In one implementation, output module 62 displays the grain quality diagnosis results in one or more preset or predefined formats on display 36. As a result, an operator of the piece of harvesting equipment or the operator/manager of the grain handling device or facility is notified of changes in grain quality, allowing the operator or manager to make manual adjustments to the piece of harvesting equipment or the grain handling facility. 

[0049] In one implementation, output module 62 further directs processor 28 to store the results of the grain quality analysis in data storage 58. For example in one implementation in which such grain quality analysis is carried out during the harvest of the grain by harvesting machine, output module 62 may additionally acquire geo-referenced signals indicating the location in a field from which grain having particular grain quality is harvested. In one implementation, output module 62 generates field maps which indicate the quality of grain harvested from different geo-referenced portions of the mapped field. In one implementation, such stored information or stored grain quality field maps is subsequently used to adjust future field operations. For example, using such stored information or stored grain quality field maps, operations such as future planting, future herbicide, insecticide or fertilizer application, future cultivation and/or future harvesting parameters may be adjusted. 

[0050] In one implementation, output module 62 additionally or alternatively utilizes the results of the grain quality analysis/diagnosis to output adjustment signals, which are transmitted to machine controller 32. In response to receiving such signals, machine controller 32 outputs adjusted control signals that adjust one or more operational parameters of the harvesting equipment, such as the combine harvester, while it is harvesting the grain. For example, in one implementation, in response to a diagnosis that there is currently a high level of material other than grain (MOG), a level above a predefined threshold of MOG, output module 62 directs processor 28 to output adjustment signals to controller 32 to output control signals such as to increase the speed of the cleaning fan which blows chaff and other foreign matter from the grain. In one implementation, in response to a diagnosis that the bulk grain contains a high level of broken, a quantity greater than a predefined threshold, output module 62 directs processor 28 to output adjustment signals to controller 32 that causes machine controller 32 to output signals to adjust a setting of the threshing component that separates grain from the rest of the plant, such as the concave spacing in a combine harvester. 

[0051] In one implementation, such adjustment is done in real time and is performed automatically in response to the grain quality results. In yet another implementation, the adjustment is recommended to an operator, or the adjustment is automatically carried out in response to receiving authorization or confirmation from the operator. In one implementation, such adjustments are automatically done only upon such grain quality values satisfying a predefined threshold for a minimum period of time. 

[0052] FIGS. 4-6 illustrate an example agricultural harvester in the form of a combine 200 that incorporates grain quality monitoring system 220, an example implementation of grain quality monitoring system 20. As shown by FIG. 4, combine 200 comprises a main frame 212 having wheel structure including front and rear ground engaging wheels 214 and 215 supporting the main frame for forward movement over a field of crop to be harvested. The front wheels 214 are driven by an electronically controlled hydrostatic transmission. 

[0053] A vertically adjustable header or harvesting platform 216 is used for harvesting a crop and directing it to a feeder house 218. The feeder house 218 is pivotally connected to the frame 212 and includes a conveyor for conveying the harvested crop to a beater 219. The beater 219 directs the crop upwardly through an inlet transition section 222 to a rotary threshing and separating assembly 224. In other implementations, other orientations and types of threshing structures and other types of headers 216, such as transverse frame supporting individual row units, are utilized. 

[0054] The rotary threshing and separating assembly 224 threshes and separates the harvested crop material. Grain and chaff fall through a concave 225 and separation grates 223 on the bottom of the assembly 224 to a cleaning system 226, and are cleaned by a chaffer 227 and a sieve 228 and air fan 229. The cleaning system 226 removes the chaff and directs the clean grain to a clean grain tank by a grain elevator 233. The clean grain in the tank can be unloaded into a grain cart or truck by unloading auger 230. Tailings fall into the return elevator or auger 231 and are conveyed to the rotor 237 where they are threshed a second time. 

[0055] Threshed and separated straw is discharged from the rotary threshing and separating assembly 224 through an outlet 232 to a discharge beater 234. The discharge beater 234 in turn propels the straw out the rear of the combine. It should be noted that the discharge beater 234 could also discharge crop material other than grain directly to a straw chopper. The operation of the combine is controlled from an operator's cab 235. 

[0056] In the example illustrated, the rotary threshing and separating assembly 224 comprises a cylindrical rotor housing 236 and a rotor 237 located inside the housing 236. The front part of the rotor and the rotor housing define the infeed section 238. Downstream from the infeed section 238 are the threshing section 239, the separating section 240 and the discharge section 241. The rotor 237 in the infeed section 238 is provided with a conical rotor drum having helical infeed elements for engaging harvested crop material received from the beater 219 and inlet transition section 222. Immediately downstream from the infeed section 238 is the threshing section 239. 

[0057] In the threshing section 239, the rotor 237 comprises a cylindrical rotor drum having a number of threshing elements for threshing the harvested crop material received from the infeed section 238. Downstream from the threshing section 239 is the separating section 240 wherein the grain trapped in the threshed crop material is released and falls to the cleaning system 228. The separating section 240 merges into a discharge section 241 where crop material other than grain is expelled from the rotary threshing and separating assembly 224. 

[0058] An operator's console 250 located in the cab 235 includes conventional operator controls including a hydro shift lever 252 for manually controlling the speed range and output speed of the hydrostatic transmission. An operator interface device 254 in the cab 235 allows entry of information into a controller 255 comprising an on-board processor system, which provides automatic speed control and numerous other control functions described below for the harvester 200. The operator can enter various types of information into the operator interface device 254, including crop type, location, yield and the like. In the example illustrated, combine harvester 200 additionally comprises display 257 for presenting information to the operator. In some implementations, display 257 may additionally serve as an input device, such as when display 257 comprises a touch screen. In other implementations, display 257 may be combined with interface device 254, such as part of counsel 250. 

[0059] Signals from the sensors include information on environmental variables such as relative humidity, and information on variables controlled by the on-board control system. Signals include vehicle speed signals from a radar sensor or other conventional ground speed transducer 260, rotor and fan speed signals from transducers 262 and 264, and concave clearance and chaffer and sieve opening signals from transducers 266, 268 and 270, respectively. Additional signals originate from a grain loss sensor 272a at the exit of the rotary threshing and separating assembly 224 and left- and right-hand grain loss sensors 272b at the exit of the cleaning system 226, and various other sensor devices on the harvester. Signals from a mass flow sensor 278a, a grain moisture sensor 278b, a tailings volume sensor 278c, and relative humidity, temperature and material moisture sensors 278d, 278e and 278f are also provided. 

[0060] A bus directs signals from the mentioned sensors and an engine speed monitor, a grain mass flow monitor, and other microcontrollers on the harvester to the controller 255. Signals from the operator interface 254 are also directed to the controller 255. The controller 255 is connected to actuators for controlling adjustable elements on the harvester. Feedback signals from the actuators are input to the controller 255. 

[0061] The actuators controlled by the controller 255 comprise an actuator 280 controlling the rotational speed of the rotary threshing and separating assembly 224, an actuator 282 controlling the clearance of the concave 225, an actuator 284 controlling the opening of a pre-cleaner of the chaffer 227, an actuator 286 controlling the opening width of the chaffer 227, an actuator 288 controlling the opening of the sieve 228, an actuator 290 controlling the speed of the air fan 229, and an actuator 292 controlling the output speed of the hydrostatic transmission and thus the ground speed of the combine. These actuators are known in the art and thus only schematically indicated in FIG. 3. 

[0062] FIGS. 5 and 6 illustrate grain quality monitoring system 220, an example implementation of grain quality monitoring system 20. System 220 is similar to system 20 except that system 220 is specifically illustrated as carrying out method 100 with respect to images of crops being conveyed along both clean grain elevator 233 and a tailings elevator 231 of combine harvester 200 shown in FIG. 4. FIG. 5 illustrates one example set of hardware of combine harvester 200 that forms grain quality monitoring system 220. As shown by FIG. 5, grain quality monitoring system 220 comprises clean grain image source 294, tailings image source 296, image analyzer 298 as well as controller 255 and operator station display 257, described above. FIG. 6 schematically illustrates components of clean grain image source 294, tailings image source 296 and image analyzer 298. 

[0063] As shown by FIG. 5, clean grain image source 294 comprises a side passage or bypass 300 along clean grain elevator or conveyor 233, wherein grain, including material other than grain, is siphoned, at a predetermined rate or proportion, across a bypass and across a camera for the capturing of images. In other implementations, clean grain image source 294 comprises a measuring chamber into which grain is filled intermittently and removed. As shown by FIG. 6, clean grain image source 294 additionally comprises bypass fill sensor 308, bypass motor controller 310 and camera 312. Fill sensor 308 comprises a sensor which outputs signals indicating the filling of the bypass 300 (shown in FIG. 5). Bypass motor controller 310 outputs control signals which control the motor that extracts or withdraws grain for sampling from clean grain elevator 233, wherein the withdrawal of grain is at a predefined or predetermined relationship with the amount of grain being conveyed by elevator 233, such that the withdrawn sample corresponds to the full amount of grain being conveyed and accurately reflects the characteristics of the full amount of grain being conveyed. Camera 312 comprises a color camera that captures images of current contents or material filling bypass 300 and outputs image signals which are transmitted to image analyzer 298. In other implementations, camera 312 may comprise other types of cameras. In an alternative implementation, the images from the camera 312 are used by the fill detection module 342 to control the bypass motor controller 310 and the bypass fill sensor 308 is not needed. 

[0064] Although clean grain image source 294 is illustrated as comprising a bypass 300 through which grain is driven and along which camera 312 captures bulk grain images, in other implementations, clean grain image source 294 is additionally or alternatively provided at other locations along which harvested grain flows to the grain tank. For example, in other implementations, camera 312 is alternatively located directly along elevator 233, rather than within a bypass. 

[0065] Tailings image source 296 comprises a side passage or bypass 320 along tailings elevator or conveyor 231, wherein tailings are siphoned, at a predetermined rate or proportion, across a bypass and across a camera for the capturing of images. In other implementations, tailings image source 296 comprises a measuring chamber into which grain is filled intermittently and removed. As shown by FIG. 6, tailings image source 296 additionally comprises bypass motor controller 322 and camera 324. Bypass motor controller 322 outputs control signals which control the motor that extracts or withdraws grain for sampling from tailings elevator 233, wherein the withdrawal of tailings is at a predefined or predetermined relationship with the amount of grain being conveyed by elevator 233, such that the withdrawn sample corresponds to the full amount of grain being conveyed and accurately reflects the characteristics of the full amount of grain being conveyed. Camera 322 comprises a color camera that captures images of current contents or material filling bypass 320 and outputs image signals which are transmitted to image analyzer 298. In other implementations, camera 324 may comprise other types of cameras. 

[0066] Images from clean grain image source 294 and tailings image source 296 are transmitted to image analyzer 298. U.S. Pat. No. 8,831,292 issued on Sep. 9, 2014 to Brueckner et al. entitled METHOD AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE OPTICAL EVALUATION OF HARVESTED CROP IN A HARVESTING MACHINE, the full disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, describes image recording systems 52, 52', other examples of clean grain image source 294 and tailings image source 296. 

[0067] Image analyzer 298 comprises a processor and associated program logic in the form of code, software and/or circuitry that provide instructions to the processor for controlling image sources 294, 296, for analyzing and processing image data received from sources 294, 296 to estimate grain quality. In one implementation, similar to processor 28 and memory 40 described above, image analyzer 298 carries out method 100. In another implementation, image analyzer 298 classifies image samples based upon probabilities that are based upon features calculated irrespective of segment boundaries and features calculated based on identified boundaries of segments as will be described hereafter. The results from image analyzer 298 are transmitted to controller 255, similar to controller 32, to automatically adjust one or more operational parameters of combine harvester 200. In particular, controller 255 transmits adjustment signals to one or more of actuators 280, 282, 284, 26, 288, 290 and 292 based upon such grain quality results. The results from image analyzer 298 are further transmitted to display 257 for presentation to the operator of combine harvester 200. 

[0068] As shown by FIG. 6, image analyzer 298 comprises video module 340. Image analyzer 298 further comprises fill detection modules 342, 344 and grain quality module 346, 348 for image sources 294, 296, respectively. Video module 340 comprises program logic for receiving image signals from cameras 312, 322 and outputting such images to display 257 described above. 

[0069] Fill detection modules 342, 344 comprises program logic for analyzing images received from cameras 312, 322 to determine the extent to which bypasses 300, 320 are filled with sample grain or sample tailings for analysis. FIGS. 7A-7C illustrate images of an example bypass 300 along which sampled or extracted grain flows, wherein such figures illustrate complete filling of the bypass 300. Similar image analysis is performed for tailings bypass 320. Based upon an extent to which bypasses 300, 320 are filled, fill detection modules 342, 344 output signals to bypass motor controllers 310, 322, to control or adjust the rate at which grain or tailings are extracted from elevators 233, 231 and conveyed through bypasses 300, 320, respectively. Such closed loop control regarding the filling of bypasses 300, 320 facilitates optimization for fill levels for image processing and classification. In the example illustrated, the control of bypass motor controller 310 is additionally based upon signals from bypass fill sensor 308. In other implementations, bypass fill sensor 308 is omitted, wherein the control of bypass motor controller 310 for bypass 300 is controlled entirely based upon image processing of images received from camera 312. 

[0070] Grain quality modules 346 and 348 comprise program logic for carrying out method 100. As described above, each of grain quality modules 346, 348 receives images from its associated camera 312, 324. Grain quality modules 346, 348 then apply a filter or feature extractor to such images to extract or compute at least one feature of the bulk grain depicted in the image. Each of grain quality modules 346, 348 further samples values for at least one feature at different selected or sampled sampling locations of the bulk grain image. For each sampling location, grain quality modules 346, 348 determine a probability for at least one classification of material at the sampling location based upon the extracted or calculated feature or features. Grain quality modules 346, 348 determine a quality of the bulk grain of the entire image based upon an aggregate of probabilities for the classification of each of the multiple different sampling locations. The quality results are then transmitted to controller 255 and display 257 (shown in FIG. 5). As noted above, in another implementation, image analyzer 298 classifies image samples using classification probabilities additionally based upon features calculated from image segments as will be described hereafter. 

[0071] FIG. 8 schematically illustrates grain quality monitoring system 420, another example implementation of grain quality monitoring system 20. Grain quality monitoring system 420 is similar to grain quality monitoring system 20 except that grain quality monitoring system 420 classifies image samples additionally based upon features calculated from image segments. Although grain quality monitoring system 420 is described as determining or estimating grain quality using images captured from a single image source, such as clean grain image source 294 described above, in other implementations, grain quality monitoring system 420 estimates grain quality additionally based upon images from a second image source, such as tailings image source 296, by applying the same image analysis upon images captured from tailings image source 296. 

[0072] As shown by FIG. 8, grain quality monitoring system 420 comprises bulk grain image source 294, image analyzer 426, controller 255 and display 257 (controller 255 and display 257 being shown in FIGS. 4 and 5). Image analyzer 426 comprises a processor and associated program logic in the form of code, software and/or circuitry, stored in a non-transitory computer-readable medium or memory, that provides instructions to the processor for controlling bulk grain image source 294 and for analyzing and processing image data received from source 294 to estimate grain quality. Image analyzer 426 comprises image quality module 430, overlap and fill detection module 432, segmentation module 434, feature extraction module 436, crop and variety detector 438, classifier or classification module 440 and conversion and filtering module 442. 

[0073] Image quality module 430 directs processor 28 in analysis of the quality of bulk grain images received from image source 294. Image quality module 430 analyzes such images to identify or detect circumstances which may impair the quality of such images such as bad focus, bad lighting, bad color, material stuck on the glass window through which images are captured, smudges on the glass, moisture in the glass or dirt on the glass. The outputted diagnostics 431 are presented on display 257. In one implementation, in response to detecting poor image quality in particular areas of the bulk grain image, image quality module 430 warns an operator of such bad areas or of the extent of such bad areas if the images exceeds the predefined threshold. In one implementation, image quality module 430 takes additional remedial action such as digitally masking out poor quality areas of such images. In some implementations, image quality module 430 is omitted. 

[0074] Overlap and fill detection module 432 analyzes bulk grain images received from image source 294 to perform two main functions: monitoring and controlling filling of bypass 300 (shown in FIG. 5) and tracking of bulk grain movement through bypass 300. As discussed above with respect to fill detection module 342 in FIG. 6, module 432 analyzes images received from source 294 to determine the extent to which bypass 300 is filled with bulk grain. Based upon intensity gradients and other image characteristics, module 432 determines the extent to which bypass 300 is filled with bulk grain. The result is the output of a percent fill signal 433 indicating the percent of the bulk grain image that is filled with bulk grain. Based on the detected fill of bypass 300, module 432 direct processor 28 to output control signals controlling operation of bypass motor controller 310. In one implementation, module 432 outputs signals when bypass unit has been sufficiently filled such that only images taken when bypass 300 has been sufficiently filled are utilized for grain quality analysis. In another implementation, module 432 identifies unfilled portions of a bulk grain image and outputs a signal such that empty portions of the bulk grain image are not evaluated or processed. 

[0075] Module 432 further tracks movement of grain across bypass 300 to identify overlapping of bulk grain images and avoid double counting of the same bulk grain sample. In one implementation, module 432 assumes mostly linear motion of bulk grain across bypass 300 and across camera 312 (shown in FIG. 6). Module 432 analyzes sequential images and generates correlation scores for portions of bulk grain images. Based upon the correlation scores, module 432 identifies overlapping portions of such images, wherein such overlapping portions are not double counted. As a result, the load on processor 28 is reduced. 

[0076] FIGS. 9A-9C illustrate one example of such bulk grain tracking FIG. 9A illustrates a first bulk grain image 450 of wheat received by image analyzer 298. FIG. 9B illustrate a second bulk grain image 452 of wheat received by image analyzer 298, wherein image 9B comprises an old fraction 454 and a new fraction 456. Old fraction 454 comprises the portion of an image that has already been captured and has undergone or is currently undergoing analysis. New fraction 456 comprises newly received bulk grain that has not yet been previously captured and utilized for grain quality analysis. Module 432 compares one or more selected portions 460 of image 450 with portions of image 452 to identify those portions of different images that sufficiently match such that such portions of the images are deemed as being overlapping and redundant. In one implementation, module 432 compares different images to produce correlation diagram 464 such as shown in FIG. 9C in which correlation is indicated by brightness and those portions having a brightness above a predefined threshold are deemed as being overlapping portions of different images. Based upon correlation indicators or results between portions 460 and 462, module 432 identifies movement of the same portion of grain to identify or estimate boundaries between old fraction 454 and new fraction 456 of each of the bulk grain images received from bulk grain image source 294. In some implementations, such overlap detection or grain tracking by module 432 is omitted. 

[0077] As indicated by arrow 470, new fractions 456 of the bulk grain image are directly analyzed by feature extraction module 436. As indicated by arrow 472, the same new fractions 456 of the bulk grain image are additionally segmented by segmentation module 434 before being analyzed by feature extraction module 436. Feature extraction module 436 extracts features from both the bulk grain image as a whole (as described above with respect to block 106 of method 100) and from segments of the bulk grain image. In an alternate implementation, the entire image 452 is analyzed by feature extraction module 436 and segmented by segmentation module 434 instead of only the new fractions 456. 

[0078] Segmentation module 434 performs segmentation upon the received bulk grain image. During segmentation, module 434 carries out image processing or analysis to estimate boundaries of distinct pieces, particles or objects, referred to as segments, in the bulk grain image. FIG. 10A illustrates an example bulk grain image 476 of wheat. For purposes of illustration, FIG. 10B conceptually illustrates segmentation of image 476 to produce segmented image 478, identifying the perimeter or boundaries of different objects 480, wheat and distinct objects, pieces or particles other than wheat, in the bulk grain image 476. FIG. 10B conceptually depicts and visibly distinguishes examples of different segments that are calculated or identified by segmentation module 434. In one implementation, segmentation module 434 discards those portions of image 476 that are not identified as being within the perimeter boundaries of a segment. As indicated by arrow 479, the segments identified by segmentation module 434 are transmitted to feature extraction module 436 for analysis. In another implementation, segment module 434 identifies those portions of image 476 that are not identified as being within the perimeter boundaries of a segment such that features are not extracted from such non-segment portions of image 476. 

[0079] Feature extraction module 436 extracts image features from the bulk grain image received from overlap and fill detection module 432 and segment features from the identified segments from the same bulk grain image received from segmentation module 434. Extraction of image features from the bulk grain image is described above with respect to feature module 50 in FIG. 1; block 104 in FIG. 2; and the example image feature extraction shown in FIGS. 3B-3E above. Feature extraction module 436 further extracts features from the segments in the segmented bulk grain image received from segmentation module 434. FIG. 11A illustrates application of a feature extractor by feature extraction module 436 to form feature extracted segmented bulk grain image 489, which illustrates extracted values for a particular feature for each of the segments in the bulk grain image 476. In the example illustrated, segmentation of the bulk grain image 476 results in the identification of individual segments 486, wherein the boundaries of such segments 486 are identified. In the example illustrated, feature extraction module 436 applies a feature extractor that is based on the computed area of a segment. The different values for the extracted feature are illustrated with different brightness levels in the diagram of FIG. 11B, wherein individual segments having feature values falling within a predefined associated range are illustrated with a particular brightness. 

[0080] FIG. 11B illustrates the application of a different feature extractor to the identified segments 486 of the bulk grain image 476 of FIG. 10A to form feature extracted segmented bulk grain image 491. In the example illustrated, feature extraction module 436 applies a feature extractor that computes the contrast of the intensity of all the pixels in bulk grain image 476 that fall within a particular segment. In the feature extracted segmented bulk grain image of FIG. 11B, the contrast value of each segment is illustrated by a different brightness level, wherein those segments having values falling within a predefined associated range are illustrated with a particular brightness. FIGS. 11A and 11B illustrate just two example feature extractors that may apply to the identified segments based on characteristics of the segments and/or the pixels within the segments. In other implementations, different or additional feature extractors are applied to the segments identified in the bulk grain image. Examples of such segment features which may be extracted from the segments of the bulk grain image include, but are not limited to, roundness, convexity, contour length, major and minor axes, min/max brightness within the segment, surface fitting to the intensities within the segment, and variance in brightness and color within the segment. The extracted feature or features from feature extraction module 436 based upon both the bulk grain image and the individual segments identified in the bulk grain image are transmitted to crop and variety detector module 438 and classification module 440 for further analysis. 

[0081] As shown by FIGS. 11A and 11B, each of the individual pixels contained within the boundary of an identified segment is assigned the same set of feature values. For example, if the extracted feature comprises a shape or size characteristic of an identified segment, such as the area of a segment, the identified value for the shape or size of the segment is assigned to each of the pixels within the boundary of the identified segment. In circumstances where the feature being extracted is based not only on the boundaries of a segment but also on characteristics that vary from pixel to pixel within the boundaries of the identified segment, each of the pixels within the boundaries of the identified segment are assigned the same single value based upon or derived from the different values of the different individual pixels within the boundaries of the identified segment. For example, in one implementation, an average, median, largest observation, smallest observation or other statistic derived from the values of the different pixels within the boundaries of the segment is assigned to each of the pixels within the boundaries of the associated segment. 

[0082] Crop and variety detector module 438 analyzes the values for the one or more features extracted by feature extraction module 436 for the segments identified in the feature extracted segmented bulk grain images and the feature filtered bulk grain images to identify the type of the particular crop and possibly the particular variety of the crop presently being harvested. The determined or identified crop type and variety are output as signals 439 for recording with the particular associated geo-referenced locations currently being traversed by harvester 200. In one implementation, the determined or identified crop type and variety are further displayed on display 257. For example, a field may be planned with multiple crop types or multiple varieties. Crop and variety detector module 438 detects changes in the crop type and variety as the harvester is crossing the field and records changes in crop variety and type with respect to different geo-referenced locations in the field. In one implementation, the grain quality results may further be stored and associated in memory with the particular identified crop variety and type as well as the particular geo-referenced locations in the field. In one implementation, the detected crop type is output to the controller 255 (shown in FIG. 5) so that the controller can change its control strategy based on the detected crop type. 

[0083] In one implementation, the detected crop type is used by the classification module 440 to choose from a set of crop specific parameters. For example, in one implementation, based upon the detected crop or the detected variety of crop being harvested, classification module 440 accesses lookup tables or utilizes mathematical relationships linking or corresponding calculated feature values and probabilities for classification of materials. For example, in one implementation, classifier 440 consults a first lookup table or utilizes a first mathematical relationship of feature values to probabilities to determine a probability that a particular material classification exists at a particular sampling location for a first identified crop such as corn. In contrast, classifier 440 consults a second different lookup table or utilizes a second different mathematical relationship of feature values to probabilities to determine a probability that a particular material classification exists at a particular sampling location for a second identified crop such as wheat, soybeans, barley, canola, oats or the like. 

[0084] In yet other implementations, the crop and variety detector module 438 is excluded or is manually overridden, wherein the user specifies the crop type to classification module 440. In in yet another implementation, the crop and variety detector module 438 is excluded and the classification module 440 uses generic parameters/lookup tables/mathematical relationships linking feature values to classification probabilities, wherein a single lookup table or a single mathematical relationship or formula is utilized for a particular class of material, such as MOG light, MOG heavy, clean grain and the like, across all crop types. 

[0085] In one implementation, crop and variety detector 438 additionally compares the values received from feature extraction module 436 for one or more features to normal, typical or standard values or ranges of values to determine a degree or level of confidence that the particular feature values received from module 436 are actually for the crop that is being harvested. In such an implementation, crop and variety detector 438 outputs signals representing a confidence level indication 441. In one implementation, the confidence level 441 is used by the controller 255 to change how it interprets the signals 496 indicating quality of grain. In another implementation, the confidence level indication 441 is presented on display or other output to an operator. For example, in one implementation, in circumstances where the values for the features received from module 436 are so different from typical feature values for the crop being harvested, detector 438 will output signals indicating an extremely low level of confidence for the results ultimately presented by system 420. In one implementation, if the differences between the feature values received and the expected feature values exceed a predefined threshold, a warning indication may be displayed or audibly presented to the operator. Such a difference resulting in a low confidence level may be the result of the operator inputting the wrong crop type or the harvester temporarily traversing an abnormal region of a field containing an abnormal patch of plants. 

[0086] Classification module 440 operates similar to classification module 54 as described above except that classification module 440 determines the probability for the presence of a particular material classification at each of the different sampling locations additionally based upon the value for a single feature or based upon values of multiple features at each sampling location of the feature extracted segmented images. For example, in one implementation, classification module 440 determines the probability for the presence of MOG at sampling location 132A based upon the value for a first feature at the corresponding sampling location 132A in feature image 122 (FIG. 3B), the value for a second feature at the corresponding sampling location 132A in feature image 124 (FIG. 3C), the value for a third feature at the corresponding sampling location 132A in feature image 126 (FIG. 3D), the value for a fourth feature at the corresponding sampling location 132A in feature image 130 (FIG. 3E), as well as the value for a fifth feature at the corresponding sampling location 132A in segmented feature extracted image 489 (FIG. 11A) and the value for a sixth feature at the corresponding sampling location 132A in the segmented feature extracted image 491 (FIG. 11B). 

[0087] Similar to classification module 54, classification module 440 determines a probability, as described above, for a particular classification at each of a multitude of different sampling locations. For example, classification module 440 (1) determines a first probability for the presence of a particular material classification, such as MOG, at sampling location 132A, (2) determines a second probability for the presence of the same particular material classification, such as MOG, at sampling location 132B, (3) determines a third probability for the presence of the same particular classification, such as MOG, at sampling location 132C, and so on for each sampling location. Although FIG. 3A illustrates five sampling locations 132, in other implementations, classification module 54 may determine classification probabilities at a greater or fewer of such sampling locations. 

[0088] In one implementation, classification module 440 directs processor 28 to determine a probability for each of multiple different material classifications at each sampling location 132. For example, in one implementation, classification module 440 assigns each sampling location a probability for each of a plurality of different classifications. For example, classification module 440 may assign the sampling location a probability of x % that the image sample is depicting a first classification of material and a probability of z % that the sampling location is depicting a second classification of material and so on, wherein the sum of the probabilities does not exceed 100%. For example, in one implementation, classification model 440 directs processor 28 to determine a probability for the presence of a first material classification, such as broken grain, at a sampling location as well as a probability for the presence of a second different material classification, such as MOG, MOG heavy or MOG light, at the same sampling location. 

[0089] In one implementation, classification module 440 consults a predetermined lookup table containing different values for different combinations of features, and different probabilities for different classifications of materials corresponding to the different values for the different combinations of features. As noted above, in one implementation, a specific lookup table is dedicated for each crop type or for each different variety of crop. In another implementation, multiple tables are utilized, wherein each specific lookup table is used for a specific set or group of related crops or related varieties. In other implementations, a generic lookup table is utilized across all crop types or across all varieties. In one implementation, probability entries in the lookup table are generated by taking multiple grain samples, capturing an image of each of the multiple grain samples, and having experts or trained human operators label different parts of the image to form labeled images 490. FIGS. 12-15 illustrate captured bulk grain images of wheat, corn, soybeans and canola that have been labeled by human operators for use in generating different lookup tables for each of the different crop types. The labeled bulk grain images are digitally input and stored for use by training module 492. In an alternate implementation, a mathematical relationship is used instead of a lookup table. 

[0090] Training module 492 comprises a processor and associated program logic which direct generation of a lookup table or mathematical relationship through machine learning by using a large list of feature vectors and label pairs. As part of such training, feature extraction module 436 applies filters and feature extractors to the labeled bulk grain images to extract feature vectors for each sampling location of the labeled bulk grain image. Subsequently, training module 492 uses the label at each sampling location to determine the desired probabilities of the material at that sampling location and associates these desired probabilities with the set of extracted features at that sampling location. Such probabilities and corresponding set of feature vectors are stored as part of the lookup table subsequently used by classification module 440 when analyzing grain quality. In an alternate implementation, a mathematical relationship between feature vectors and probabilities is generated and stored instead of a lookup table. 

[0091] In the example illustrated, classification module 440 is operable in one of various modes selectable by a user of system 420, wherein system 420 analyzes bulk grain for different classifications of material. Examples of different classifications of material for which classification module 440 makes a prediction with regard to each sampling location include, but are not limited to, one or more ranges regarding material other than grain (MOG), such as MOG light, MOG heavy or other classifications such as hull, broken, sticks, stock, cobs, stems, pods, unthreshed grain, skinned grain, and clean grain. In other implementations, classification module 440 may predict other classifications of material depending upon a particular grain type and the particular plant from which the grain is harvested. The probabilities for such other classifications are provided in lookup tables or mathematical relationships that are generated similarly to the generation of the lookup table or mathematical relationship described above with respect to labels 490 and training module 492. 

[0092] Conversion and filtering module 442 converts or maps the image sample classification probabilities across the entire bulk grain image received from classification module 440 to a percent by weight output for different classifications of materials in the bulk grain. Conversion and filtering module 442 determines and outputs a signal or signals 496 indicating quality of grain for the bulk grain image based upon an aggregate of the probabilities, for the particular material classification, of the different image samples constituting the bulk grain image. In the example illustrated, module 442 outputs, to display 257 and controller 255, grain quality information such as percent by mass/weight clean, percent by mass/weight broken, percent by mass/weight material other than grain light, percent by mass/weight material other than grain heavy and percent by mass/weight unthreshed. In one implementation, module 442 further calculates statistics regarding such grain quality results, wherein instantaneous, filtered, and the uncertainty in the measurements are calculated for display, machine control, and storage. 

[0093] In the example illustrated, conversion and filtering module 442 applies a calibration function to a statistic derived from an aggregate of the different classification probabilities of the different image samples. In one implementation, module 442 converts image sample classification probabilities across an image to a percent by mass/weight for a classification of material for the image by applying a calibration function in the form of a linear curve which maps average classification probability across the bulk grain image to a ground truth percent by weight or percent by mass for the classification of material. FIG. 16 illustrates an example linear curve mapping average of classification probability outputs across the bulk grain image or across multiple bulk grain images (algorithm weighted average) to the ground truth percent by mass or percent by weight percentage (ground truth) for an example class of material, such as unthreshed grain for a crop such as wheat. During run time of harvester 200, conversion module 442 averages the classification probabilities of the different image samples across one or more bulk grain images and converts the averages to percent by mass or percent by weight values using the conversion relationship represented by the linear curve. 

[0094] FIG. 17 illustrates example methods by which a calibration function, such as the example calibration function shown in FIG. 16, is calculated or determined. FIG. 17 is a flow diagram illustrating an example method 500 for the generation of a calibration function, using ground truth values, to be used in converting aggregate classification probabilities into percent by weight values. As indicated by blocks 502, 504, a sample of grain in grain elevator 233 is removed and transmitted across bypass 300. As indicated by block 506, images of the bypass sample are taken. As indicated by blocks 512 and 514, features are extracted or calculated from each image, wherein material classification probabilities are determined and assigned to each sampling location as described above with respect to classification module 440. 

[0095] In one implementation, as indicated by block 520, the bypass grain sample from which the images in block 506 were obtained is then separated into different material components, such as by passing the actual bypass grain sample through a cleaner in block 522 and a shaker in block 524. As indicated in block 526, actual values for the percent by weight for the different classifications of material are measured. 

[0096] In an alternative implementation, as indicated by block 530, in lieu of utilizing images captured from a bulk grain bypass, the calibration function is alternatively determined using a sample taken from the grain tank, such as from the grain tank of the harvester, during the general time at which the grain for the bypass sample was acquired. As indicated by blocks 532 and 534, this grain tank sample is also separated into different material components, such as by passing the actual grain tank sample through a cleaner in block 532 and a shaker in block 534. As indicated by block 536, actual values for the percent by weight for the different classifications of material are measured. 

[0097] As indicated by arrows 540, the actual percent by weight values for the different classifications of material determined in blocks 526 and/or 536 can be used as ground truth percent by weight 542 to determine a calibration function 548. As indicated by arrows 544, a relationship between the ground truth percent by weight 542 for each class of material and the aggregate of the different classification probabilities of the different image samples is determined. This relationship is defined and used to identify a calibration function 548, such as the example calibration function shown FIG. 16, for use in subsequent run time conversion of aggregations of the different classification probabilities of different images to percent by weight values for the different classes of material. 

[0098] In yet another implementation, in lieu of determining actual class mass/weight percentages from bulk grain samples drawn from a harvester bypass (block 504) or alternatively drawn from the grain tank (block 530), the calibration function is alternatively determined using engineered grain samples with known amounts of each type of material, wherein the grain samples are processed to get a system response and wherein the calibration function, such as a linear curve mapping aggregate classification probability outputs to ground truth mass or weight percentage, is generated. 

[0099] In one implementation, module 442 further applies filters over multiple instantaneous output signals 496, such as applying a simple weighted moving window filter that accounts for image overlap, resulting in filtered output signals 496. In one implementation the weights in the filter are dependent on time. In an alternate implementation, the filter weights are dependent on the amount of material that has moved past the imager, as computed by the overlap and fill detection module 432. 

[0100] In one implementation, module 442 further produces estimates of the uncertainty in the output signals 496 using the classification probabilities generated by the classifier 440. For example, an image of bulk grain that contains image samples classified as MOG light with very high probability and all other classes with very low probability will result in a low uncertainty output signal. Conversely, an image of bulk grain that contains image samples classified with some probability as MOG light and some probability as unthreshed will result in a higher uncertainty signal. In another implementation, the amount of variance in the instantaneous output signal computed from individual images of bulk grain is used to determine the uncertainty output signal 496. In one implementation, the uncertainty output signal 496 is used by the controller 255 to change how it interprets the instantaneous and/or filtered signals 496 indicating quality of grain. 

[0101] FIG. 18 is a functional flow diagram of an example method 600 for monitoring grain quality. Method 600 is carried out by system 420 illustrated in FIG. 8. As indicated by block 602, overlap and fill detection module 432 receives images of bulk grain and analyzes such images to determine overlap of consecutive images and to identify images that are not completely filled with grain. Once an image 604 suitable for analysis has been identified--being full of grain or having empty image portions cropped and accounting for overlap with previous images--feature extraction module 436 applies feature extractors to the image 604 to extract or calculate a stack of different features 606, which are irrespective of segment boundaries, from the bulk grain image 604. Segmentation module 434 performs segmentation on the same image 604 to produce a segmentation 608 of the bulk grain image 604. Feature extraction module 436 then applies different feature extractors to extract or calculate a stack of different features 610 from the segmentation 608 and the bulk grain image 604. As indicated by block 612, classification module 440 combines the stack of features 606 and 610 to form feature vectors for each of multiple sampling locations taken from bulk grain image 604. As indicated by block 614, classifier module 440 determines a classification score, namely, classification probabilities 616 for each sampling location of the overall image 604 based upon the feature vectors in each bulk grain image. FIG. 18 illustrates example sampling location probabilities for MOG light 618 and unthreshed 620 material classifications using sampling locations aligned on a regular grid of every fourth pixel in the x and y directions of the input image 604. In this illustration, sampling locations with high probabilities for that material classification are shown as bright and low probabilities are shown as dark. Such classification probabilities are at the level of a sampling location, and not at the level of a segment or "particle" as defined by boundaries of the segment or "particle". As a result, classification probabilities generally vary across objects in the bulk grain image, as illustrated by the varying brightness in 618 and 620 across sampling locations that fall within a single object in bulk grain image 604. As an additional result, multiple classes of material may have probabilities at the same sampling location, as illustrated by the medium brightness in sampling location 640A of both MOG light 618 and unthreshed 620, showing classification uncertainty at those sampling locations. Furthermore, because the classifier 614 incorporates image features 606 irrespective of segment boundaries and generates classification probabilities at sampling locations independent of segments, portions of objects in the bulk grain input image 604 can be correctly classified even if those objects are not present in the segmentation 608, as shown by the probability 618 of the thin piece of MOG light at sampling location 640B. 

[0102] As indicated by block 622, module 442 aggregates the classification probabilities from all the sampling locations in the image. As indicated by block 624, module 442 applies a calibration function to the aggregated sample probabilities to determine a percent by mass/weight value for the class of material for the entire image 604. As indicated by block 626, module 442 further applies filtering to output an estimate of weight percentages for classes of material. Such estimates of weight percentages include, but are not limited to, percent by weight clean grain, percent by weight broken grain, percent by weight material other than grain light, percent by weight material other than grain heavy and percent by weight unthreshed grain. In one implementation, the output signals additionally include uncertainty estimates of the weight percentages. 

[0103] In one implementation, the same process described above with respect to FIG. 18 is applied to bulk grain images received from bulk grain image source 296, which provides images of tailings. In such an implementation, segmentation of an image and the extraction of segment features may be excluded due to the expected large amount of overlapping material other than grain. In one implementation, the monitoring of tailings produces percent by weight for classifications of materials comprising "free grain" and/or classifications of materials comprising "tailings/MOG-light". In one implementation, the monitoring of tailings additionally produces results for classification of materials comprising "unthreshed grain". In yet another implementation, monitoring of tailings additionally produces results for an "empty" class when a tailings image is partially empty. 

[0104] Although the present disclosure has been described with reference to example embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the claimed subject matter. For example, although different example embodiments may have been described as including one or more features providing one or more benefits, it is contemplated that the described features may be interchanged with one another or alternatively be combined with one another in the described example embodiments or in other alternative embodiments. Because the technology of the present disclosure is relatively complex, not all changes in the technology are foreseeable. The present disclosure described with reference to the example embodiments and set forth in the following claims is manifestly intended to be as broad as possible. For example, unless specifically otherwise noted, the claims reciting a single particular element also encompass a plurality of such particular elements.

Description


CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS 

[0001] This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 14/243,323, filed Apr. 2, 2014, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/807,376, titled CONTROL ARRANGEMENT AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING A POSITION OF A TRANSFER DEVICE OF A HARVESTING MACHINE and filed Apr. 2, 2013, each of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. 

FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE 

[0002] The present invention pertains to a control arrangement for controlling a position of an adjustable transfer device of a harvesting machine. 

BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE 

[0003] Forage harvesters are used in agriculture to harvest plants from a field, to chop them and to unload them by means of an adjustable transfer device onto a container of a transport vehicle that drives on a side of the forage harvester. The position of the adjustable transfer device, normally arranged in the form of a spout, can be controlled by an operator by means of inputs on a hydraulic handle and actuators, normally hydraulic cylinders, in order to move the adjustable transfer device into a position in which the crop is unloaded onto the container of the transport vehicle, but not onto the ground. Usually, the adjustable transfer device can be rotated around a vertical axis, tilted around a horizontal axis to adjust the height of its outer end, and an end flap can be rotated in order to define the exhaust direction of the crop. 

[0004] Since the control of the adjustable transfer device is exhausting for the forage harvester operator, automatic solutions have been proposed for controlling the transfer device that use data on the relative position of the harvesting machine and the container, or a optical image capture device with an image processing system. The latter however are not always able to identify the container correctly, in particular when a field is opened, i.e. the forage harvester harvests a first strip of the field with standing crop on both sides such that the transport vehicle needs to follow the forage harvester, and the container to be filled is towed behind a tractor following the forage harvester, such that the distance between the forage harvester and the container is relatively large. 

SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE 

[0005] A harvesting machine comprises a crop receiving header, a crop processing unit for processing crop received from the header and an adjustable transfer device for unloading processed crop onto a container of a transport vehicle. A control arrangement for controlling a position of the adjustable transfer device of the harvesting machine includes a optical image capture device or camera mounted on the harvesting machine. The optical image capture device has a field of view and an image signal output connected to an image processing system. The control arrangement further comprises an electronic control unit connected to an output of the image processing system. At least one actuator for adjusting the position of the adjustable transfer device is controlled by the electronic control unit. At least one sensor for sensing the actuator-controlled position of the adjustable transfer device has a signal output connected to the electronic control unit. Further, a display unit and an user interface connected to the electronic control unit. 

[0006] The electronic control unit is operable to perform or execute the following steps: 

[0007] (a) to display an image of the container captured by the optical capture device overlaid with a symbol representing, for example, but not limited to, a predetermined location of the container, such as a front edge, or incidence of crop flow ion the container, on the display unit, 

[0008] (b) to calculate a position of the spout relative to a predetermined location of a container and an expected point of incidence of crop flow on a container within the field of view of the optical image capture device based upon a sensor signal from at least one sensor and an output signal of the image processing system, 

[0009] (c) to receive adjustment inputs from the user interface for adjusting the position of the actuator and thus of the adjustable transfer device and to update the position of the symbol overlaid on the image on the display unit according to the altered sensor output; 

[0010] (d) to receive a confirmation input from the user interface once the symbol in the image on the display is in an appropriate position with respect to the displayed image of the container in order to fill the container with crop, and to derive at least one feature in the image representing the container; and 

[0011] (e) to subsequently track the container within the output signal of the image processing system based on the image feature retrieved in step (d) and to control the actuator accordingly to fill the container with crop.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS 

[0023] A combination of two agricultural machines shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B comprises a self-propelled harvesting machine 10 in the form of a forage harvester (FIG. 1A) and a transport vehicle 12 (FIG. 1B) in the form of a self-propelled tractor, which, by way of a tow bar 14 pulls a trailer 16, which comprises a container 18. 

[0024] The harvesting machine 10 has a frame 20, which is carried by front-driven wheels 22 and steerable rear wheels 24. The harvesting machine 10 is operated from a driver's cabin 26, from which an operator can see a harvesting attachment 28, in the form of a corn header attachment, which is affixed to an entry channel 30 on the front side 10A of the forage harvester 10. Crop plants 58 harvested from a field 34 by way of the harvesting attachment 28 are conveyed to a cutter head 36 via a gathering conveyor (not shown) with pre-compression rollers (not shown) located in the entry channel 30. The cutter head 36 acts in this embodiment as a crop processing unit for processing the crop plants 58 received from the harvesting attachment 28, hence chops them into small pieces and delivers them to a discharge accelerator 38. A post-processing device 42 with two kernel processing rollers (not shown) is located removably in the crop flow between the cutter head 36 and the discharge accelerator 38. The post-processing device 42 can be moved into an inoperative position in case that it is not needed, for example for a grass harvest, or entirely removed from the harvesting machine 10. 

[0025] The driving of the aforementioned drivable units of the harvesting machine 10 and the harvesting attachment 28 takes place by way of a combustion engine 44. The crops discharged from the discharge accelerator 38 exit the harvesting machine 10 to the container 18 that can be moving behind, as shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B, or alongside the harvesting machine 10, via an adjustable transfer device 40 in the form of a discharge spout 45, which can be rotated around an approximately vertical axis by way of a first actuator 46 and can be adjusted at a tilt angle by way of a second actuator 48. The discharge direction can be changed by way of a flap 50, the angle of which can be adjusted by way of a third actuator 52. 

[0026] The transport vehicle 12 and the trailer 16 with the container 18 have a conventional structure. The transport vehicle 12 comprises front, steerable wheels 64 and rear, driven wheels 66, which are supported on a carrying structure 68, which carries a driver's cabin 70. 

[0027] FIGS. 1A and 1B show the harvesting machine 10 and the transport vehicle 12, respectively, in side views. One can see that the harvesting machine 10 drives over the field 34 in a forward direction A, which is in FIG. 1A to the left, in order to harvest the crop plants 58. The transport vehicle 12, FIG. 1B, follows behind the harvesting machine 10 in a forward direction B. This situation occurs when a field 34 is opened, for example when only an entry to the field is available at the center of a side edge of a field 34, such that there is no possibility for the transport vehicle 12 to drive alongside the harvesting machine 10 without damaging crop plants 58. During subsequent passes over the field 34, the transport vehicle 12 can drive on a harvested part of the field 34 on the left or right side of the harvesting machine 10. The harvesting machine 10 then moves along an edge of crops, which represents a border between a harvested area of the field 34 and the still standing plant population consisting of crop plants 58 on the field 34, and is reaping the crop plants 58. The transport vehicle 12 is then thus moving on the harvested part 56 of the field, parallel to the harvesting machine 10, along a path on which the crop plants 58 chopped by the harvesting machine 10 arrive at the container 18 by way of the adjustable transfer device 40. The transport vehicle 12 must therefore always move parallel next to the harvesting machine 10. 

[0028] The harvesting machine 10 is steered by a driver sitting in the driver's cabin 26 or by a steering device, which operates automatically. The transport vehicle 12 is equipped with a steering device so as to facilitate or automate the parallel movement relative to the harvesting machine 10, and which can be omitted. The harvesting machine 10 could also be any other self-propelling harvesting machine, such as a potato or beet harvester. 

[0029] The harvesting machine 10 is equipped with a first position-determining device 72, which is located on the roof 73 of the cabin 26. A first radio antenna 74 is also positioned there. The transport vehicle 12 is equipped with a second position-determining device 76, which is located on roof 77 of the cabin 70. A second radio antenna 78 is also located there. 

[0030] Now turning to FIG. 2, which is a top view of the harvesting machine (forage harvester) 10 opening a field by harvesting and chopping the crop plants 58 from a section of the field as it moves forward. The forage harvester 10 then unloads the chopped material through the spout 45 to a container 18 (e.g., cart) pulled by the transport vehicle 12 (e.g. tractor), which is following behind the harvesting machine 10. 

[0031] In FIG. 2, the distance D of the harvesting machine (forage harvester) 10 and the transport vehicle 12 can be variable, and the spout 45 needs to be adjusted so the material coming out from the spout 45 will land in the container 18. In addition, the transport vehicle 12 path might not be perfectly aligned with the forage harvester 10, and the spout 45 also needs to be adjusted to take into account the left/right offset. 

[0032] Now, reference is made to FIGS. 3A and 3B, in which among other things, the individual components of the position-determining devices 72, 76, an electronic control unit 112, actuators 46, 48, 52 for the adjustment of the adjustable transfer device 40 and discharge spout 45, sensors 128, 130, 132 for the detection of their actual position and the steering devices of the transport vehicle 12 (FIG. 3B) and the harvesting machine 10 (FIG. 3A) are schematically shown. Electronic control unit 112 includes a processor and memory. Operating and executable software are stored in memory and executed by the processor. Sensor 128 detects the position of the adjustable transfer device 40 around the vertical axis, as adjusted by actuator 46. Sensor 130 detects the tilt position of the adjustable transfer device 40, as adjusted by actuator 48. Sensor 132 detects the angular position of the flap 50, as adjusted by actuator 52. Some of the above mentioned components are also illustrated in FIG. 1A. 

[0033] Now turning to FIG. 3A, the first position-determining device 72 is on board the harvesting machine 10 and comprises an antenna 74 and an evaluation circuit 82, which is connected to the antenna 80. The antenna 80 receives signals from satellites of a position-determining system, such as GPS, Galileo, or Glonass, which are supplied to the evaluation circuit 82. With the aid of the signals of the satellites, the evaluation circuit 82 determines the actual position of the antenna 80. The evaluation circuit 82 is also connected to a correction data-receiving antenna 84, which receives radio waves radiated from reference stations at known locations. With the aid of the radio waves, correction data for the improvement of the accuracy of the position-determining device 72 are produced by the evaluation circuit 82. The evaluation circuit 82 transmits its position data by way of a bus line 86 to a control device 88. 

[0034] The control device 88 is connected via an interface 90 to a reception and transmission device 92, which is in turn connected to the radio antenna 74. The reception and transmission device 92 receives and generates radio waves, which are picked up and radiated by the antenna 74. 

[0035] Analogously, the second position-determining device 76 is located on board the transport vehicle 12. The second position-determining device 76 comprises an antenna 94 and an evaluation circuit 96, which is connected to the antenna 94. The antenna 94 receives signals from satellites of the same position-determining system as the antenna 80, which are supplied to the evaluation circuit 96. With the aid of the signals of the satellites, the evaluation circuit 96 determines the actual position of the antenna 94. The evaluation circuit 96 is also connected to a correction data-receiving antenna 98, which receives radio waves radiated from reference stations at known sites. With the aid of the radio waves, correction data for the improvement of the accuracy of the position-determining device 76 are generated by the evaluation circuit 96. 

[0036] By way of a bus line 100, the evaluation circuit 96 transmits its position data to a control device 102. The control device 102 is connected via an interface 104 to a reception and transmission device 106, which in turn is connected to the radio antenna 78. The reception and transmission device 106 receives and generates radio waves, which are picked up and radiated by the antenna 78. By the reception and transmission devices 92, 106 and the radio antennae 74, 78, it is possible to transmit data from the control device 88 to the control device 102 and vice-versa. The connection between the radio antennae 74, 78 can be direct, for example, in a permissible radio range, such as citizen's band radio, or something similar, or made available via one or more relay stations, for example, if the reception and transmission devices 92, 106 and the radio antennae 74, 78 work according to the GSM or the UMTS standard or another suitable standard for mobile telephones. 

[0037] The control device 102 is connected to a steering device 108, which controls the steering angle of the front, steerable wheels 64 of the transport vehicle 12. Furthermore, the control device 102 sends speed signals to a speed specification device 110, which, via a variation of the engine rpm of the transport vehicle 12 and/or the gear transmission, controls the speed of the transport vehicle 12. Moreover, the control device 102 is connected to a permanent storage unit 120. 

[0038] On board the harvesting machine 10, the control device 88 is connected to the electronic control unit 112, which, together with the actuators 46, 48, 52 it controls and the sensors 128, 130, 132 connected to it, forms a control arrangement for the control of the transfer of the crops from the harvesting machine 10 to the container 18 of the transport vehicle 12. The electronic control unit 112 is connected to a steering device 114, which controls the steering angle of the rear, steerable wheels 24. Furthermore, the electronic control unit 112 sends speed signals to a speed specification device 116, which, via a variation of the gear transmission, controls the propelling speed of the harvesting machine 10. The electronic control unit 112 is also connected to a throughput sensor 118, which detects the distance between the pre-compression rollers in the entry channel 30, with a sensor for the detection of the position of sensing arms 62 placed on a divider tip of the harvesting attachment 28; a permanent storage unit 122, via valve devices (not shown) with the actuators 46, 48, and 52 and with sensors 128, 130, 132, which respectively detect the position of one of the actuators 46, 48, and 52, and with an optical image capture device 136, which is placed more or less in the middle of the adjustable transfer device 40 on its left or right or underside 40A (FIG. 1A), and during the harvesting operation, is aligned on the container 18 and is preferably implemented as a stereo-camera having two lenses 137 and two image sensors (not shown) arranged one above the other or side by side. The electronic control unit 112 receives the signals from the optical image capture device 136 via an image processing system 138 that processes the image signals from a signal output of the optical image capture device 136 in order to extract the position of features of the container 18 within the field of view 135 of the optical image capture device 136. 

[0039] Further, the electronic control unit 112 is connected to an user interface 140A mounted in the cabin 28. The user interface 140A comprises a display unit 142 and an user interface with keys 144, which could also be complemented or replaced by a touch-sensitive display unit 142A. Another user interface 140B with at least one key 148 is provided on a hydraulic handle 146 (not shown) that is pivotally mounted and coupled with a sensor 150 connected to the electronic control unit 112 in order to receive manual propelling speed commands by the operator in the cabin 28. Some of the above mentioned components are also illustrated in FIG. 1A. 

[0040] Operation of the electronic control unit 112 are schematically shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B. Now turning to FIG. 4A, after start in S300, i.e. after a harvest operation switch (which might be one of the keys 144 or another key, not shown, on a dashboard in the cabin 28) of the harvesting machine 10 is switched on, and the operation of the electronic control unit 112 is initialized, step 302 follows. In step 302, it is checked whether a container search command was received from the user interfaces 140A, 140B (FIG. 3A), thus from a key 144 or a key 148 assigned to input the desire of the operator to locate a container 18 at a position where it is difficult to locate by the optical image capture device 136. Such a position is, in particular, the position behind the harvesting machine 10 and the transport vehicle 12, as shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B, since the container 18 is relatively far away from the optical image capture device 136. Under certain circumstances, as bad visibility or a container 18 having a color similar to the color of the field 34, it can however also be useful and possible to input a container search command when the container 18 is alongside the harvesting machine 10. 

[0041] If the result of step S302 is "no," step S304 follows. In step S304, it is checked whether the adjustable transfer device 40 is in a rear unloading position according to the signal of the sensor 128. If this is not the case, step S306 is executed, in which the electronic control unit 112 controls actuators 46, 48, 52 according to the signal from the optical image capture device 136, processed by image processing system 138. This means that in the image from the optical image capture device 136, features are identified, for example the upper edge 19 of the container 18 (FIG. 1B), and the actuators 46, 48, 52 are controlled such that the crop flow expelled by the adjustable transfer device 40, hits the interior of the container 18. A feedback for the impact point of the crop plants 58 on the container 18 can be derived from the image signal from the optical image capture device 136. Further, since the optical image capture device 136 is a stereo camera, its signals allow to estimate a distance between the harvesting machine 10 and the container 18 and the height of the upper edges 19 of the container 18 over ground, such that the actuators 46, 48 and 52 can be controlled according to a known kinematic model of the free crop flow downstream the adjustable transfer device 40. 

[0042] On the other hand, if the result in step S302 or S304 is "yes," the electronic control unit 112 proceeds with step S308. This step and the following ones are used to find a container 18 in the image of the optical image capture device 136 in difficult cases, such as a rear unloading situation shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B, in which it is not easy for the electronic control unit 112 to identify the container 18 in the mentioned image. 

[0043] In step 308, the electronic control unit 112 calculates a position of an expected point of incidence of the crop flow on the container 18, if it is within the field of view 135 of the optical image capture device 136 (FIG. 1A). The calculation first identifies the container 18 in the field of view 135 in an image captured by the optical image capture device 136. Next, expected points of incident within the container 18 are calculated based on the captured image. Thus, if no container 18 is in the field of view 135 of the optical image capture device 136, the process terminates here and goes back to step S300. If on the other hand a container 18 is in the field of view 135 of the optical image capture device 136, the position of an expected point of incidence of the crop flow on the identified container 18 is calculated, based upon the sensor signal in order to learn the direction of the crop flow after leaving the adjustable transfer device 40, and based on an output signal of the image processing system 138, since the electronic control unit 112 needs to know the distance between the harvesting machine 10 and the container 18 in order to derive the expected point of incidence. The distance between the discharge spout 45 of harvesting machine 10 (or the machine 10 itself, e.g. the rotation point of the discharge spout 45 around the vertical axis) and the front edge 19A of the container 18 can be derived from the signal of the image processing system 138 since the optical image capture device 136 is a stereo camera. If the optical image capturing device 136 were a monocular camera, the size (pixels) of the near edge of the container 18 in the image could be used as an estimate for the mentioned distance. Additionally or instead, the mentioned distance can be derived from position data of the harvesting machine 10 using the position-determining device 72 and a position of the transport vehicle 12 transmitted by the radio antennas 74, 78. The orientation of the spout 45 based on position of actuator 46, 48, or 52 is used to determine the path of crop flow. 

[0044] In step S308, the known model kinematic of the free crop flow downstream the adjustable transfer device 40 is applied, like in step S306, to calculate where the crop flow would theoretically intersect top plane of the container 18 opening. This position can be calculated in absolute coordinates, for example using the position data from the first position-determining device 72, or in relative coordinates with an origin for example at the rotation point of the adjustable transfer device 40 around the approximately vertical axis. 

[0045] Step S308 is followed by step S310, in which an image of the container 18 is shown on the display unit 142 together with a symbol 800 (FIG. 8A and 8B) representing alignment of spout 45 with front edge 19A of container 18 that coincides with the calculated expected point of incidence of the crop flow on the container discussed above. In other words, the crop flow will intersect the calculated expected point of incidence when symbol 800 is aligned with front edge 19A of container 18. The image can be non-processed, i.e. directly come from the optical image capture device 136, or be pre-processed by the image processing system 138 in order to remove unimportant details and to emphasize, for example by adding color or changing brightness, features identified in the image that might resemble the container 18. 

[0046] In step S312, the electronic control unit 112 checks whether a confirmation input was received via an assigned one of the keys 144 and/or 148 from the user interface 140A, 140B. By depressing the key, the operator in the cabin 28 can confirm that according to his or her opinion the symbol in the image on the display unit 142 is in an appropriate position with respect to the displayed image of the container 18 to fill the container 18 with crop (FIG. 8B). This confirmation input could also be input by means of a touch-sensitive display unit 142A or orally or by a suitable gesture detector. Thus, if the result of step S312 is "no," it can be assumed that the symbol 800 shown on the display unit 142 is outside the image of the container 18. 

[0047] In this case, step S314 follows in which the electronic control unit 112 can receive adjustment inputs from the user interface (by means of keys 144 and/or 148) for adjusting the position of one or more of the actuators 46, 48, 52 and thus of the adjustable transfer device 40. The electronic control unit 112 thus controls the position of the actuators 46, 48 and/or 52. Step S314 is followed again by step S308, in which a new image is taken by the optical image capture device 136, and by step S310, in which the position of the symbol 800 in the image on the display unit 142 is updated according to the output of the sensors 128, 130, 132, which is now changed due to the movement of one or more of the actuators 46, 48, 52. In the situation where symbol 800 is not aligned with front edge 19A of container 18 (FIG. 8A.), the operator can move symbol 800 in alignment with front edge 19A of container 18 thereby actuating actuator 46 to rotate spout 45 into position aligned with container 18 for rear unloading in which the symbol 800 is located on the display unit 142 aligned with the image of front edge 19A of the container 18 (FIG. 8B). The adjustment of the symbol 800 to the front edge 19A of the container 18 can be performed, if necessary, in the horizontal direction and in the vertical direction, be it simultaneously or subsequently, dependent on the operator's choice or as provided by an automated system. Another embodiment of the present invention considers the container 18 being pulled on a side of the harvesting machine 10 where the symbol 800 can be adjusted to align with the upper lateral edge of the container 18 or a side opening thereof. Other embodiments of the present invention can accommodate container orientations relative to the harvesting machine 10, whether the container is aft, forward, or along-side of the harvesting machine 10, and any feature of the container 18 within the field of view of the optical capture device 136. 

[0048] On the other hand, if the operator has confirmed in step S312 that the symbol 800 in the image on the display unit 142 is in an appropriate position with respect to the displayed image of the container 18 (FIG. 8B.) to fill the container 18 with crop, step S316 is executed, in which the control unit 112 derives at least one feature in the image representing the container. This is relatively easy, since the container 18 can be assumed to be in close vicinity to symbol 800. The electronic control unit 112 thus uses in step S316 the known position of the symbol and suited features in the vicinity of the symbol 800 in the image. The electronic control unit 112 can identify the upper edges 19A of the container 18 in the image. The identified feature is preferably highlighted in the image on the display unit 142, for example by color or brightness. 

[0049] In the following step S318, the electronic control unit 112 tracks the container 18 within the output signal of the image processing system 138 based on the image feature retrieved in step S316 and controls the actuators 46, 48, 52 in a suitable manner, as described with respect to step S306, in order to fill the container 18 with the harvested crop without spilling significant amounts of crop onto the ground. In step S318, actual images can be shown on the display unit 142 (FIG. 8B), like in step S310, in order to inform the operator about the position of the container 18 as detected by the electronic control unit 112 (preferably highlighting the detected and tracked feature of the container 18) and the expected location of the crop impact point on the container 18 by means of the symbol 800. 

[0050] FIG. 4A can be summarized as follows: 

[0051] S300: Start 

[0052] S302: Container Search Command Received (key 148) 

[0053] S304: Adjustable transfer device 40 in Rear Position (Sensor 128) 

[0054] S306: Control Actuators 46, 48, 52 according to signal from image capture device (e.g., camera) 136. 

[0055] S308: Calculate a position of the spout 45 (or transfer device) relative to a predetermined location of a container and an expected point of incidence of the crop flow on a container within the field of view of the optical image capture device based upon the sensor signal and on an output signal of the image processing system. 

[0056] S310: Display an image of the container 18 together with a symbol 800 on the display unit representing the alignment of spout 45 with front edge 19A of container 18, which is coincident with the calculated expected point of incidence of the crop flow on the container. Though Step 310 is presented chronologically or sequentially following Step 308, one embodiment of the present invention (not illustrated) provides for Step 310 to precede Step 308. 

[0057] S312: Confirmation input from the user interface received to confirm that the symbol in the image on the display is in an appropriate position with respect to the displayed image of the container to fill the container with crop? 

[0058] S314: Receive adjustment inputs from the user interface for adjusting the position of the actuator(s) 46, 48, 52 and control the actuator(s) 46, 48, 52. 

[0059] S316: Derive at least one feature in the image representing the container 18. 

[0060] S318: Track the container 18 within the output signal of the image processing system based on the image feature retrieved in step S316 and control the actuator(s) accordingly to fill the container 18 with crop. 

[0061] Now turning to FIG. 4B that can be summarized as follows: 

[0062] S320: Start. 

[0063] S322: Rear Unload Command from User Interface. 

[0064] S324: Position spout automatically for rear unloading. Any commercially available software that performs the automated spout positioning function can be incorporated into the present invention. Electronic control unit 112 receives the rear unload command from the user interface 140A. The ECU 112 manipulates actuators 46, 48, 52 to position the spout 45 into a known orientation that is reasonable for rear unloading. Sensors 128, 130, 132 provide feedback to the ECU 112 to close the feedback loop on the orientation of the spout 45. 

[0065] S326: Image showing a visual alignment indicator 800 (e.g., cross hairs, cross or target as shown in FIG. 8A and 8B) to be aligned with front edge 19A of the container. The visual alignment indicator is created in the electronic control unit 112. The visual alignment indicator 800 is overlaid on top of the image from the camera 136 and streamed to the display unit 142 that the operator sees. Ideally, the operator would maneuver the spout 45 of the harvester 10 such that the visual alignment indicator 800 is pointed to the front edge 19A of the contain 18 and press a button to engage the system. The system would then identify the front edge 19A of the container 18 and track its position. 

[0066] S328: Confirmation of input from operator (Yes or No) 

[0067] S330: If S328 indicates no confirmation of input from operator, then spout adjustments are made and repeat S326. 

[0068] S332: If S328 indicates confirmation of input from operator, then the tracking algorithm automatically chooses salient features to be used for tracking the front edge 19A of the container 18. The salient features are unique regions in the images that are on the front side of the container 18. 

[0069] S334: Track features and actuate spout. Once the salient features on the front side of the container 18 are selected, the crosshairs 800 could either disappear from the overlay or the software could automatically adjust the crosshairs 800 to point at the center of the front edge 19A of the container 18. 

[0070] It will become apparent that various modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, one or more functions of the electronic control unit 112 can be provided by separate electronic control units, not shown. In steps S306 and S318, control of the adjustable transfer device 40 can be augmented according to a relative position of the container 18 with respect to the harvesting machine 10 derived from position data of the harvesting machine 10 using the position-determining device 72 and a position of the transport vehicle 12 transmitted by the radio antennas 74, 94. 

[0071] Now turning to FIG. 5 to illustrate one embodiment of the tracking processes of the present invention for rear unloading. 

[0072] Block 510: Indicator 800, such as cross hairs (FIGS. 8A and 8B), are aligned with the front edge 19A of the Container 18. 

[0073] Block 512: Stereo Camera captures the salient features from the video (FIGS. 8A and 8B) and 3-D data near the front edge 19A of the container 18 and use it as the tracking template. 

[0074] Block 514: The relative location of the front edge 19A of the container with respect to the forage harvester 10 is computed from the 3-D stereo measurement of the salient features. The salient features of the front edge 19A are identified automatically by the tracking algorithm based on unique appearance or shape. 

[0075] Block 516: The horizontal direction, tilt and flap of the discharge spout is adjusted based on the relative location of the front edge 19A with respect to the forage harvester 10. 

[0076] Block 518: A check is performed whether the rear unloading process is terminated by the operator. If the check is "Yes," then the process continues to Block 522 and the procedure to done. If the check is "No," then the process continues to Block 520 to capture a new image from the camera of the container and the process returns to Block 514 for continued processing. 

[0077] Now turning to FIG. 6 for an alternative embodiment of the present invention that utilizes position measuring devices on both the harvesting machine and transporting vehicle to assist the optical capture device in measuring the relative motion between the harvesting machine (forage harvester) 10 and transport vehicle 12 of FIG. 7. 

[0078] Block 610: An indicator 800, such as a cross hairs, is aligned with the front edge 19A of the container (FIGS. 8A and 8B) and spout 45 is adjusted to align with the front edge 19A of the container 18 as discussed above. 

[0079] Block 612: A stereo camera 136 (FIG. 1A) captures the salient features from the video and 3-D data near the front edge 19A of the container and use it as the tracking template. 

[0080] Block 614: A series of steps are performed: 

[0081] Compute the relative location of the front edge 19A of the container with respect to the forage harvester 10 from the 3-D stereo measurement of the salient features. 

[0082] Compute the relative location X.sub.1 of the forage harvester 10 and the transport vehicle 12 based on their GPS coordinates from their respective GPSs 700, 702.

CLAIM OF PRIORITY 

[0001] This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. .sctn.119(e) to provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 61/959,347, filed Aug. 21, 2013. The entire contents of the prior-filed provisional application are hereby incorporated by reference. 

FIELD OF USE 

[0003] The present disclosure relates to the field of data processing, and more particularly, relates to methods to improve a reliability of physical unclonable function circuits. 

BACKGROUND 

[0004] Over the past decade, silicon physical unclonable function ("PUF") circuits have emerged as highly useful blocks in the design of secure hardware in applications such as identification, authentication and even encryption key generation. In general, PUF circuits derive their randomness from uncontrolled random variation phenomena that occur during the silicon chip manufacturing process. Rather than store a set of random bits, PUF circuits generate these random bits every time they are activated. 

[0005] Most PUF implementations can do so by amplifying some electrical characteristic (e.g., delay or threshold voltage) from two nominally identical circuit components in the PUF core. For example, delay based PUF circuits, e.g., an arbiter type or ring oscillator type generate their random bits by amplifying a difference in delays of two nominally identical delay paths. Bi-stable element based PUF circuits, e.g., based on static random access memory (SRAM) or sense amplifier technology generate their random bits by amplifying differences in strengths of two or more transistors using a positive feedback structure (e.g., a cross-coupled inverter pair). 

[0006] These electrical differences, especially when small, can flip a polarity in conditions involving environmental variations, e.g., voltage and temperature changes, in the presence of ambient noise, or over aging, resulting in some bits of the raw PUF circuit response being unreliable. Previous hardware studies have shown that for some designs more than 25% of the PUF circuit response bits may be unreliable across environmental variations. Since differences of larger magnitude require larger variations to flip polarity, larger electrical differences generally result in more reliable PUF circuits. Although some applications, such as identification and authentication, can be designed to tolerate a few errors in the response without significant loss of security, many applications can benefit from more reliable PUF circuits, and applications such as key generation require the PUF circuit response to be perfectly reliable. 

[0007] The conventional methods to improve PUF circuit reliability use powerful error correction codes (ECC) to correct the raw response from the PUF circuit core. Unfortunately, these ECC blocks generally have significant VLSI overheads that can quickly scale up as the number of bits of correction increases. 

[0008] Alternate techniques can increase a reliability of the PUF core and thus significantly reduce a strength (and complexity) of the ECC used. One method of increasing the reliability of the PUF core is to use normally detrimental integrated circuit (IC) aging effects to reinforce a desired (or "golden") response of the PUF by permanently altering the PUF circuit characteristics such that the difference in the electrical characteristic is increased in magnitude, and hence making the PUF more reliable. 

[0009] Previous work used the IC aging phenomena of negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) to improve reliability of an SRAM circuit by approximately 40%. Despite its efficacy in increasing the SRAM circuit reliability, NBTI-based response reinforcement requires long baking times (e.g., greater than 20 hours) that are incompatible with an industrial high-volume-production manufacture and test flow. 

[0010] Further, the high temperatures needed for NBTI-based reinforcement cannot be applied selectively, and thus would detrimentally age all circuits on the chip. Finally, transistor V.sub.TH shifts due to NBTI are not permanent, and the transistors can return to near their initial characteristics over time. NBTI can typically achieve a permanent V.sub.TH shift (after recovery) of only approximately 10-40 mV in PMOS devices over years of stress (equivalent to over tens of hours of accelerated aging under elevated voltage and temperature). 

[0011] Therefore, a need exists for techniques and circuits to improve a reliability of a PUF circuit. 

SUMMARY 

[0012] The present disclosure relates to a PUF circuit response reinforcement technique based on hot carrier injection (HCI) that can reinforce a PUF golden response in short stress times (e.g., tens of seconds), without impacting the surrounding circuits, and that has high permanence (e.g., does not degrade significantly over aging). In some implementations, a self-contained HCI-reinforcement-enabled PUF circuit can be based on sense amplifiers (SA) that can autonomously self-reinforce with minimal external intervention. 

[0013] In some implementations, SA-based PUF circuits can have good randomness and uniqueness characteristics similar to those of SRAM-based PUF circuits. At its core, an SA-based PUF circuit is similar to an SRAM-based PUF, and both may belong to a family of bi-stable PUF circuits. 

[0014] In one aspect, a method includes obtaining a physical unclonable function (PUF) circuit, said PUF circuit configured to provide, during a first operational mode, an output signal that is dependent on an electric characteristic of the PUF circuit, and causing the PUF circuit to enter a second operational mode by applying a stress signal to the PUF circuit that changes an absolute value of the electric characteristic, relative to another value of the electric characteristic during the first operational mode of the PUF circuit, and adjusting, based on changing the absolute value of the electric characteristic, a bias magnitude of the output signal relative to another bias magnitude of the output signal during the first operational mode of the PUF circuit. 

[0015] Implementations can include one or more of the following features. Adjusting, based on changing the absolute value of the electric characteristic, the bias magnitude of the output signal can include changing the bias magnitude of the output signal relative to a previous bias magnitude of the output signal before the application of the stress signal. Applying the stress signal to the PUF circuit that changes an absolute value of the electric characteristic can include applying the stress signal to the PUF circuit to increase the absolute value of the electric characteristic. Adjusting, based on changing the absolute value of the electric characteristic, the bias magnitude of the output signal can include increasing a probability of the PUF circuit for resolving to a certain output value during a plurality of times the PUF circuit is operated in the first operational mode, relative to another probability of the PUF circuit resolving to the certain output value independent of the adjusting. Causing the PUF circuit to enter the second operational mode can include stressing the PUF circuit by a response reinforcement process to increase the value of the electric characteristic, relative to the other value of the electric characteristic during the first operational mode of the PUF circuit, wherein the response reinforcement process is based on a circuit aging phenomena. Causing the PUF circuit to enter the second operational mode can include stressing the PUF circuit by a response reinforcement process to increase the value of the electric characteristic, relative to the other value of the electric characteristic during the first operational mode of the PUF circuit, wherein the response reinforcement process is selected one or more of a) hot carrier injection, b) negative-bias temperature instability, c) positive-bias temperature instability, and d) electromigration. 

[0016] The method can include restoring the PUF circuit to the first operational mode, following a certain duration of the stress signal; and exiting the second operational mode. For example, the PUF circuit can include a delay based PUF circuit. The PUF circuit can include a bistable based PUF circuit. Obtaining the PUF circuit can include obtaining a substrate that comprises the PUF circuit, wherein the output signal is further dependent on one or more physical characteristics of the substrate. 

[0017] The electric characteristic can include a first electric characteristic, and the method can further include causing each of a first input and a second input of the PUF circuit to be set to a predetermined voltage level, wherein the first and second inputs of the PUF circuit are respectively connected to at least a first circuit component having the electric characteristic as a first electric characteristic and a second circuit component having a second, different electric characteristic; and receiving the output signal of the PUF circuit, wherein the output signal is based on the first and second electric characteristics. 

[0018] The first and second circuit components can include first and second transistor devices, respectively, and the first and second electric characteristics comprise first and second threshold voltages, respectively, for the corresponding first and second transistor devices. The output signal can be based on a difference between a first and a second delay value for the corresponding first and second circuit components. The output signal can be based on a difference in magnitudes between the first and second threshold voltages. 

[0019] For example, the method can include during the second operational mode applying the stress signal as a first stress signal to a first one of the first and second transistor devices, and applying a second, different stress signal to a second, different one of the first and second transistor devices. For example, the method can include during the first operational mode, storing first and second transistor device output values that are based on the bias magnitude of the output signal, based on the first and second transistor device output values, determining which of the first and second transistors devices is to be stressed, during the second operational mode, selecting one of the first and second transistor devices to be stressed, based on the stored first and second transistor device output values, and applying the stress signal to the selected one of the first and second transistor devices. 

[0020] The stress signal can include a stress voltage signal with a stress magnitude that is greater than a voltage magnitude of an operating voltage used during the first operational mode of the PUF circuit. For example, the stress magnitude is at least 1.25 times the voltage magnitude of the operating voltage used during the first operational mode of the PUF circuit. The stress signal can include a stress circuit signal with a magnitude that is greater than a current magnitude of a current flowing during the first operational mode of the PUF circuit. 

[0021] The method can include selecting at least one of a magnitude and a duration of the stress signal, with selecting based on a magnitude of a stress signal value and a duration of the stress signal value for causing at least plurality of carriers in a first transistor device of the PUF circuit to be injected into a gate oxide of the first transistor device. Applying the stress signal to the PUF circuit can include causing a stress current with a stress current magnitude that is greater than an operating current magnitude of an operating current that is flowing during the first operational mode, wherein a flow of the stress current during the second operational mode is in a same direction as a flow of the operating current during the first operational mode. 

[0022] Adjusting, based on changing the absolute value of the electric characteristic, the bias magnitude of the output signal can include increasing a probability of the PUF circuit for resolving to a certain output value over a plurality of operating conditions, relative to another probability of the PUF circuit resolving to the certain output value independent of the adjusting. Applying the predetermined stress signal to the PUF circuit can include causing a stress current with a current magnitude that is greater than an operating current magnitude of an operating current that is flowing during the first operational mode, wherein a flow of the stress current during the second operational mode is in an opposite direction as a flow of the operating current during the first operational mode. 

[0023] The method can include re-adjusting the bias magnitude of the output signal relative to a previous value of the bias magnitude of the output signal by changing the absolute value of the electric characteristic, relative to a previous value of the electric characteristic during the first operational mode. For example, the method can include performing the re-adjusting a plurality of times over a life span of the PUF circuit. 

[0024] In another aspect, a physical unclonable function (PUF) circuit can include first and second transistor devices, wherein a first gate terminal of the first transistor device and a second gate terminal of the second transistor device comprises a first and a second input terminal, respectively, of the PUF circuit, a cross-coupling circuit, wherein the cross-coupling circuit comprises third, fourth, fifth, and sixth transistor devices, wherein gate terminals of the third and fourth transistor devices are connected in a first common gate terminal and gates terminals of the fifth and sixth transistor devices are respectively connected in a second common gate terminal, a sense enable terminal connected to a seventh transistor device, the seventh transistor device connected to the first and second transistor devices, a first output terminal connected to the first common gate terminal, a second output terminal connected to the second common gate terminal; and a response reinforcement circuit comprising a thick gate oxide device connected to the first and second transistor devices, and first and second latch circuits, wherein the first latch circuit comprises at least an eighth transistor device connected to the first output terminal and a first buffer device connected to the first input terminal, and wherein the second latch circuit comprises at least a ninth transistor device connected to the second output terminal and a second buffer device connected to the second input terminal, and a stress mode enable terminal connected to each of the thick gate oxide device, the eighth transistor device, and the ninth transistor device. 

[0025] In another aspect, a secure device can include a physical unclonable function (PUF) circuit for authenticating an identity of the secure device, wherein the PUF circuit is configured to provide, during a first operational mode, an output signal that is dependent on an electric characteristic of the PUF circuit, and a response reinforcement circuit, wherein the response reinforcement circuit is configured to cause the PUF circuit to enter a second operational mode by applying a stress signal to the PUF circuit that changes a value of the electric characteristic relative to another value of the electric characteristic during the first operational mode, and adjusting, based on changing the absolute value of the electric characteristic, a bias magnitude of the output signal relative to another bias magnitude of the output signal during the first operational mode. For example, the secure device can include a feature where the response reinforcement circuit is configured to cause the PUF circuit to enter the second operational mode based on a hot carrier injection to change the value of the electric characteristic, relative to the other value of the electric characteristic during the first operational mode.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 

[0036] The present disclosure relates to techniques and circuits for using integrated circuit (IC) aging effects including response reinforcement techniques to reinforce a PUF circuit response. For example, response reinforcement techniques and circuits can include hot carrier injection (HCI) techniques and circuits, negative-bias temperature instability (NBTI) techniques and circuits, positive-bias temperature instability (PBTI) techniques and circuits, and electromigration techniques and circuits. In some examples, a combination of one or more of these techniques can be used as the response reinforcement techniques. For instance, HCI techniques and circuits can be used to overcome shortcomings of NBTI-based reinforcement techniques. 

[0037] For example, the techniques and circuits described herein can enable high PUF reliability across environmental variations and aging, while requiring only a very short, one-time, reinforcement stress. A PUF circuit can be provided on a semiconductor substrate. In general, an individual PUF circuit can be easy to manufacture but very difficult to duplicate, even given exact manufacturing processes that produce the PUF circuits. In this respect, a PUF circuit can be characterized as a hardware analog of a one-way function. Such PUF circuits and associated response reinforcement circuits as described herein can be used in high-security devices, e.g., as a means for providing device authentication and identification in a high security network. As an example, a PUF circuit along with response reinforcement circuits can be used in a laptop or handheld device for improving device security. The response reinforcement circuits can enhance a security of the device by making the security mechanism more reliable. 

[0038] A PUF circuit can be configured to operate in two modes. For example, during a first operational mode (e.g., a normal or typical mode of operating the PUF circuit), the PUF circuit can produce an output signal (e.g., called the PUF circuit response) in response to a challenge signal. The PUF circuit response is dependent on an electric characteristic specific to the PUF circuit and/or the semiconductor substrate. For example, the electric characteristic can be, e.g., a delay or a threshold voltage corresponding to one of two nominally identical transistor devices in the PUF circuit. In some examples, the electric characteristic can be, for example, carrier mobility and/or channel length. In some examples, the response can be dependent on one or more of the above described electric characteristics, taken alone or in combination. 

[0039] When a challenge signal (e.g., a signal that comprises a generated code) is applied to an array of PUF circuits, each PUF circuit in the array can react in an unpredictable (but repeatable) way due to an interaction of the challenge signal with a physical microstructure of the PUF circuit. An exact microstructure of the PUF circuit can depend on physical factors introduced during the manufacture of the PUF circuit which are unpredictable (e.g., like a fair coin toss). A specific challenge signal and its corresponding response signal together form a challenge-response pair or CRP. 

[0040] During a second operational mode (e.g., a response reinforcement or stress mode of operating the PUF circuit), the PUF circuit may be stressed to reinforce its response signal. For example, the PUF circuit can be caused to enter the second operational mode by applying a stress signal, e.g., a high drain-source voltage or drain-source current as described in detail below with reference to FIG. 1. The stress signal can enhance or increase a value of the electric characteristic specific to the circuit (e.g., by increasing a threshold voltage, V.sub.TH, of one of the two nominally identical transistor devices in the PUF circuit). In this manner, a magnitude of the offset in the output signal or its bias to resolve to a particular polarity can be increased. That is, a strength of one of the transistor devices can be increased resulting in an increased offset or bias magnitude of the output signal. As such, stressing can increase a probability of the PUF circuit to resolve to a certain output value across a plurality of times the PUF circuit is normally operated as described in detail below. For example, the stressing can increase a probability of the PUF circuit for resolving to a certain output value over a plurality of operating conditions (e.g., different temperature, atmospheric pressure, moisture, physical strain and/or compression conditions). Controlled response reinforcement techniques can be used to improve performance and reliability in static random access memories (SRAMs). For example, such techniques can achieve an increase of more than 100 mV in transistor threshold voltage (V.sub.TH) in a short stress duration of, e.g., 10 seconds, without increasing a device temperature or a global supply voltage. In some examples, the stressing can change a polarity of the bias magnitude to be different relative to a polarity of the bias magnitude before the application of the stressing. 

[0041] In some examples, some response reinforcement techniques, including HCI response reinforcement techniques, can be used to reinforce a PUF desired or "golden" response in short stress times (e.g., tens of seconds) which is over two orders of magnitude shorter than the time needed by, e.g., NBTI stress (e.g., more than 20 hours). In this regard, the techniques can achieve better reliability. In some implementations, the response reinforcement techniques can be performed in a series of steps that may be applied in a one-time, post-manufacture process. Accordingly, no response reinforcement stress may need to be applied once the PUF circuit is released in the field. In such implementations, once stressed, the stressed PUF circuit may have high permanence, e.g., the effect of the PUF stressing does not substantially lessen over time. After the stress signal is applied for a predetermined duration, e.g., 10 seconds, the stress mode can be exited by restoring the PUF circuit to the first operational mode. 

[0042] In some examples, the response reinforcement techniques described herein may not impact circuits surrounding the PUF circuit. One reason for this is that the techniques may not need high temperatures or a high global voltage supply. For instance, an HCI response reinforcement circuit may use a targeted high voltage supply that is decoupled from the global supply voltage and has a magnitude of approximately 2.5V (nominally around 1.0V). Such a targeted high voltage supply can be connected to only a few select PUF circuits or devices selected for response reinforcement. In addition, in some implementations, the targeted high voltage supply may be typically available as an input/output (I/O) supply voltage for the semiconductor device pads and thus a dedicated extra supply may not be necessary for powering the operation of the response reinforcement circuit. 

[0043] Further, the techniques and circuit described herein may be self-contained and may autonomously self-reinforce with minimal external intervention. For example, data related to the PUF circuit response bits need not be sent off chip thus minimizing a potential for the leakage of information. In some implementations, a PUF circuit can include a bi-stable PUF circuit based on, e.g., StrongARM sense amplifiers. 

[0044] In some examples, the response reinforcement process may be used to substantially permanently alter a threshold voltage (V.sub.TH) of a transistor device in a PUF circuit after the PUF circuit is manufactured (e.g., fabricated on a semiconductor substrate). In this process, high energy semiconductor carriers can be caused to become trapped in a gate oxide of the transistor device as described with reference to FIG. 1 below. In this manner, the threshold voltage (V.sub.TH) of the transistor device may be increased and the reliability of the PUF circuit can be enhanced. 

[0045] FIG. 1 gives an overview of HCI response reinforcement techniques for an example n-channel metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (NMOS) transistor device 100. As shown, the NMOS transistor device 100 includes three terminals: a source terminal 104, a drain terminal 108, and a gate terminal 112. The NMOS transistor device 100 also includes a channel 116 that facilitates a flow of carriers 120. In some implementations, the gate terminal 112 can be separated from the channel 116 by a thin insulating layer traditionally comprising of silicon dioxide. 118. During a first operational mode (e.g., a normal mode of operating the NMOS transistor device 100), a small drain-source current 119 can flow from the drain terminal 108 to the source terminal 104 through the channel 116. 

[0046] FIG. 1(a) depicts the example NMOS transistor device 100 under typical biasing. In this instance, a gate-to-source voltage (V.sub.GS) 124 and a drain-to-source voltage (V.sub.DS) 128 of the NMOS transistor device 100 can be driven by nominal supply voltages (e.g., for illustration here these are both assumed to be 1V). As a result of the biasing, the NMOS transistor device 100 can operate in a saturation mode. A threshold voltage, V.sub.TH 130, of the NMOS transistor device 100 is a value of the gate-source voltage V.sub.GS 124 at which the channel 116 becomes conducting (e.g., through a process called "inversion" when a n-channel is induced in the transistor device 100) and connects the source and drain terminals 104, 108 of the transistor device 100 thus allowing a flow of carriers 120. 

[0047] During a second operational mode (e.g., a response reinforcement stress mode of operating the NMOS transistor device 100), the device 100 may be stressed by, e.g. increasing a magnitude of the drain-source voltage V.sub.DS 108 to a magnitude of V.sub.DS 140 as shown in FIG. 1(b) of approximately 3V (e.g., three times the V.sub.DS 108 under normal biasing conditions). In some examples, an increased magnitude of V.sub.DS can be at least twice the magnitude of V.sub.DS under normal biasing conditions. In some examples, an increased magnitude of V.sub.DS can be at least 1.25-1.5 times the magnitude of V.sub.DS under normal biasing conditions. Such an NMOS transistor device 100 that is subject to an increased V.sub.DS is a stressed NMOS transistor device 100a as shown in FIGS. 1(b)-(c). In some examples, during the stress mode, the magnitude of V.sub.DS can be a same magnitude of V.sub.DS used during normal biasing conditions. In some examples, the magnitude of V.sub.DS can be lower than a magnitude of V.sub.DS during normal biasing conditions. 

[0048] In the stress mode, the drain-source current 119 may increase in magnitude until it is a large magnitude of drain-source current 119a flowing in the NMOS transistor device 100a. In some examples, a direction of the large magnitude drain-source current 119a can be in a different direction from a direction of the pre-stress drain-source current 119. As a corresponding magnitude of V.sub.DS 108 increases, velocities of carriers 120 (e.g., ions) flowing in the NMOS channel 116 in a direction of the applied field can reach saturation. Given a short NMOS channel 116, the velocities of the carriers 120 can be said to have reached saturation in across much of the channel 116. 

[0049] In this regard, an average velocity of the carriers 120 along a direction of an applied field no longer increases despite a number of internal collisions because those collisions are random in nature. However, the carriers 120 can continue to acquire kinetic energy from the collisions. As such, a random kinetic energy of the carriers 120 in the channel 116 increases. A portion of the carriers 116 called high energy electrons or ions or hot carriers 132 may acquire more kinetic energy than the rest of the carriers 116. A population of such hot carriers 132 increases at higher magnitudes of V.sub.DS 128. 

[0050] In some instances, a small fraction of the hot carriers 132 can acquire enough energy to overcome a barrier energy of the silicon dioxide layer and get injected into a gate oxide 118 of the NMOS transistor device 100 as trapped carriers 136 (FIG. 1(b)). An NMOS transistor with carriers 136 trapped in the gate oxide 118 may need a higher V.sub.GS 124 for inversion (e.g., an induced n-channel in the NMOS transistor device 100), effectively increasing its threshold voltage V.sub.TH 130. When the stressed NMOS transistor 100a, with trapped carriers 133, is used under normal drain-source voltage V.sub.DS 108 biasing, as shown in FIG. 1(c), the stressed NMOS transistor 100a behaves asymmetrically under two normal drain-source V.sub.DS 108 biasing directions. 

[0051] For instance, as shown in FIG. 1(c), when a drain-source current 119 flows in the same direction under normal biasing, as in the stressed biasing (e.g., direction of large drain-source current 119a), such that the trapped carriers 136 are near the drain terminal 108, the NMOS transistor device 100 experiences only a slight increase in V.sub.TH 130. However, when used with the source-drain directionality reversed, such that the trapped carriers 136 are near the source terminal 104, the NMOS transistor device 100 can see a much higher increase in V.sub.TH 130. One example reason for this is that, during inversion, most of the charge carriers accumulates in the channel near the source terminal 104. With the trapped carriers 136 near the source terminal 104, a larger V.sub.GS 124 is needed to attract the carriers 116 to cause inversion. Because the carriers 136 are trapped deep into the gate oxide 118, most of the increase in V.sub.TH 130 is substantially permanent. Thus, HCI response reinforcement as described above can be a good mechanism for reinforcing the PUF circuit response signal. 

[0052] A PUF circuit employing the response reinforcement techniques described herein can be based on a bi-stable circuit that uses sense amplifiers as a core element. FIG. 2 shows an example sense amplifier (SA) circuit 200 called a StrongARM sense amplifier. The SA circuit 200 can be used in a PUF circuit (as described below in connection with FIG. 3) that uses HCI-based response reinforcement to increase a reliability of the SA circuit 200 over environmental variations and aging (e.g., multiple uses). The SA circuit 200 includes a clocked circuit 204 that can amplify a small differential voltages and output full swing digital values (e.g., "10" or "01"), which can be used in memory read paths or as voltage comparators. The SA circuit 200 includes two input terminals 208a, 208b and two output terminals 212a, 212b. The input terminals 208a, 208b are connected to the gate terminals of transistor devices 220, 230 (labelled N1 and N2 in FIG. 2). 

[0053] As shown, the two transistor devices 220, 230 can be connected to other transistor devices (labelled P1, P2, N3, and N4) 217a-b, 218a-b that are connected to each other through cross-coupling 216. As a result of this construction, the SA circuit 200 may have two stable states by construction: OUT1=1 or OUT1=0; OUT2=0 or OUT2=1. To generate a random bit, the cross-coupling 216 can be reset by forcing transistor devices 220, 230 to be equi-potential and then allowing them to resolve. 

[0054] For example, the equi-potential voltage can be driven by a voltage source V.sub.DD 240 connected to transistor devices 217a, 217b. A transistor device 250 that is connected to ground can be turned on to enable (or "fire") the SA circuit 200 by asserting an SAEN signal at a gate terminal of the transistor device 250. When transistor device 250 is turned on (e.g., SAEN=1), the source voltage V.sub.DD can be caused to be applied equi-potentially to the matched devices 217a-b, 218a-b, and 220, 230. Enabling SAEN (SAEN=1) can also cause transistor devices 260, 270 to be enabled to read the output signals OUT1 and OUT2. 

[0055] If the matched transistor devices 217a-b, 218a-b, and 220, 230 in the cross-coupled SA circuit 200 are sized and laid out symmetrically (e.g., transistors 217a, 217b are symmetrically designed and transistors 218a, 218b are symmetrically designed), then a final state of the cross-coupled SA circuit 2100 is equally likely to be an output of OUT1=1 or OUT1=0; OUT2=0 or OUT2=1 and depends on differences in relative device strengths that originate from manufacturing process variations. If manufacturing process variations are pre-dominantly random in nature, then a final state of the cross-coupled SA circuit 200 may be random and unpredictable. 

[0056] Under ideal conditions, an ideal SA circuit 200 can correctly amplify even a small input differential voltages. In practice, however, variations in the components of the SA circuit 200 (e.g., transistor devices 220, 230) may result in an offset (or bias). The offset is a measure of a natural tendency of the SA circuit 200 to resolve to a particular polarity (e.g., either "10" output or "01" output). For reliable operation, a difference in the input voltages to the SA circuit may need to be greater than the offset. 

[0057] An offset in the output signals from the SA circuit 200 can result from a combination of systematic and random variations. For example, systematic variations can be due to manufacturing gradients and layout asymmetries. Such variations can be minimized by a symmetric layout of matched devices (e.g., symmetrically arranging the layouts of transistor devices 220, 230). For example, random variations can be a result of random uncertainties in a fabrication process. Such uncertainties can include random dopant fluctuation, e.g., fluctuations in a number and location of dopants in the transistor device channel (e.g., channel 116 of FIG. 1) and gate line-edge roughness. For example, gate line-edge roughness may arise from imperfections edge smoothness of the gate material used in the transistor device affecting the effective channel length of the transistor. These imperfections can be due to random process variations which can affect nominally identically designed transistors differently, thus leading to intra-die transistor variations in on current, leakage current, and other characteristics. In some instances, the effects of such uncertainties can be mitigated by using larger components in the SA circuit 200. 

[0058] To use the SA circuit 200 as a PIM circuit core, the SA circuit input terminals 208a, 208b (IN1 and IN2 in FIG. 2) can be shorted together. For example, the input terminals 208a, 208b can be set to a same voltage level, with zero differential input. The SA circuit 200 can then be turned on by applying equal potentials to the two transistor devices 220, 230 through the voltage source V.sub.DD 240. The SA circuit 200 may resolve to an output value determined by its individual offset or bias. 

[0059] For example, an output offset or bias of the SA circuit 200 can be a strong function of the difference in threshold voltages V.sub.TH of transistor devices 220, 230. The offset (and hence a reliability) of the SA circuit 200 can be increased by increasing the difference in the V.sub.TH of transistor devices 220, 230 (e.g., by increasing an absolute value of V.sub.TH of one of the transistor devices 220, 230). To maximize the randomness of the response, the SA circuit 200 can be designed to be as symmetric as possible (thus minimizing systematic offset), but with small devices in the matched pairs 217a-b, 218a-b, and 220, 230 (thus maximizing bias magnitude). 

[0060] An offset or bias of a SA circuit 200 is strong indicator of its reliability in a PUF circuit. An SA circuit 200 with high offset (e.g., a strong bias to resolve to a particular polarity) will likely resolve to a same polarity across environmental variations and over aging. Measured hardware results as discussed in detail below show high reliability from SA-based PUF circuits with relatively large offsets (e.g., greater than 40 mV). An exact offset cutoff for such high reliability may vary with technology, design specifics, or measurement conditions. In some implementations, PUF circuits described herein may be coupled with ECC circuits to establish a predetermined error probability or bit error rate. 

[0061] FIG. 3 shows an example HCI-enabled sense amplifier (HCI-SA) based PUF circuit 300. As shown, in some implementations, a StrongARM based SA circuit 304 (e.g., a similar SA circuit 200 as shown in FIG. 2) can be used with additional response reinforcement circuit (circuit apart from SA circuit 304 shown in FIG. 3) as the HCI-SA circuit 300. Although only one HCI-SA circuit 300 is shown and described herein, it should be understood that the HCI-SA circuit 300 can be repeated as a plurality of HCI-SA circuit 300 elements in an array. 

[0062] The additional circuit included in the HCI-SA PUF circuit 300 includes latch circuit 310a, 310b to receive output values OUT1 and OUT2 from output terminals 212a, 212b during a first operational mode and apply those values to the SA circuit 304 during a second, stress mode. Each latch circuit 310a, 310b includes one or more transistor devices 312a, 212b for receiving output values OUT1 and OUT2 and tri-state buffers 314a, 314b for storing the output values as x1 and x2 respectively. For example, the HCI-SA PUF circuit 300 uses the HCI response reinforcement techniques described above (see FIG. 1 and related description) to reinforce the individual offsets or biases of each SA circuit 304 in a larger array of HCI-SA PUF circuits 300. The measurement of the offset polarity and reinforcement can be done autonomously by the HCI-SA PUF circuit 300 as described below. 

[0063] In some implementations, the HCI-SA PUF circuit 300 can be programmed for higher reliability by stressing either one or both of the transistor devices 220, 230 (labelled as N1 or N2 in FIG. 3) after manufacturing and prior to first use as the HCI-SA PUF circuit 300. For example, the HCI-SA PUF circuit 300 can be configured to select both transistor devices 220, 230 for stressing to different degrees and/or amounts. In some cases, the stressing can be performed individually for each HCI-SA PUF circuit 300 in a larger array of HCI-SA PUF circuits 300, but since an offset reinforcement circuit is self-contained for each HCI-SA PUF circuit, all HCI-SA PUF circuits 300 can be reinforced in parallel. For example, if offset0 is an offset or bias before the stressing, then the offset or bias after the stressing (e.g., offsetS) can have a same sign (i.e. polarity) as offset0 and a higher magnitude. 

[0064] The HCI-SA PUF circuit 300 can operate in two modes: a first operational mode and a second operational HCI stress mode, controlled by a stress mode enable signal, HCIMODE. In the first operational mode (e.g., signal HCIMODE=0), the HCI-SA PUF circuit 300 act as normal StrongARM SA circuit (e.g., similar to the operation of SA circuit 200 described above with reference to FIG. 2). In the HCI stress mode (e.g., signal HCIMODE=1), one of the transistor devices 220, 230 can be stressed. 

[0065] Referring to FIG. 4, an example HCI response reinforcement process 400 is shown. The HCI response reinforcement process 400 can be carried out in two steps: 1) an offset polarity measurement and storage step 404, and 2) an HCI offset reinforcement step 408. A post-stress step 436 is shown to study the effect of the example HCI response reinforcement process 400. FIG. 4 shows pre-stress signals at the gate terminals (input terminals) of the transistor devices 220, 230 as INx1 and INx2 (shown together as signals 412). In addition, FIG. 4 shows statuses of pre-stress signals, HCIMODE signal 416, SAEN signal 420 (described above in connection with FIG. 2), response signals as OUT1/OUT2 signals 424, buffered values x1 and x2 428, and source voltage value V.sub.DDH 432 during the two steps 404, 408. 

[0066] FIG. 4 also depicts post-stress signals during the post-stress step 436 at the gate terminals (input terminals) of the transistor devices 220, 230 as INx1 and INx2 signals 412, the HCIMODE signal 416, and the SAEN signal 420 (each of which are similar to the pre-stress signals described above), and post-stress response signals as out1/out2 signals 424a. 

[0067] In the offset polarity measurement and storage step 404, the HCI-SA PUF circuit 300 can determine which of the transistor devices 220, 230 is to be stressed. In some examples, during this step the HCI-SA PUF circuit 300 can be configured to select both transistor devices 220, 230 for stressing. In an example where a single one of the transistor devices 220, 230 is selected, the HCI-SA PUF circuit 300 can make the determination of which of the transistor devices 220, 230 is to be stressed based on the buffered values of x1 and x2 428. The values of x1 and x2 428 may be internally generated in the HCI-SA PUF circuit 300 during a normal operating mode of the circuit 300. 

[0068] As an illustration, assume that a threshold voltage V.sub.TH of the transistor device 220 (N1) is higher than a threshold voltage V.sub.TH of the transistor device 230 (N2) for a given HCI-SA PUF circuit 300. Further, assume that all other devices in the HCI-SA PUF circuit 300 are matched (e.g., referring to FIG. 2, each of transistor device pair's 217a-b and 218a-b are symmetrical). During the offset polarity measurement and storage step 404, the HCI-SA PUF circuit 300, when fired, may resolve to an output characterized as OUT1=1, OUT2=0 (asserted by signals OUT1/OUT2 424). These values can be latched as buffered values of x1=1, x2=0 (e.g., by asserting buffered values x1/x2 428). 

[0069] During the second step of offset reinforcement 408, the HCIMODE signal is asserted to HCIMODE=1. Further, transistors P3 and P4 318a, 318b can be disabled and the tri-state buffers Tx1 and Tx2 314a, 314b can be enabled. The values at x1 and x2 428 can force the values at INx1/INx2 412 to IN1x=1 and IN2x=0. Thus, during the offset reinforcement step 408, transistor device N1 420 is selected to be stressed. 

[0070] After the initial conditions are set as described above, the voltage value V.sub.DDH 432 is asserted as a pulse of high voltage (approximately 3V) resulting in a high current path through transistor device P0 322 (e.g., a PMOS transistor device having a thick gate oxide), transistor device N1 220, and transistor device N5 328. Each of the transistor device P0 322, transistor device N1 220, and transistor device N5 328 is sized such that most of the voltage drop (e.g., approximately 2.5-2.8V when provided with a pulse of 3V) is seen across the drain-source terminals of the stressed transistor device N1 220. This creates the stress conditions for transistor device N1 220 as described above in connection with FIG. 1 and results in an increased threshold voltage V.sub.TH for transistor device N1 220 when the HCI-SA PUF circuit 300 is later used as a PUF in normal mode (e.g., post-stress step 436). 

[0071] In some examples, the HCI-SA PUF 300 circuit can be configured to stress both transistor devices 220, 230, (e.g., one at a time or simultaneously). For example, the process described above for selecting one of the transistor devices 220, 230 can be repeated but with different values of x1 and x2 so that a different one of the transistor devices 220, 230 can be stressed (e.g., at a different voltage level, duration, and/or direction) than the selected one of the transistor devices 220, 230 in the process above. For example, if both transistor devices 220, 230 are selected to be stressed at the same time, but with different voltage levels, durations, and/or directions, the response reinforcement circuit can be modified to supply the different stress signals. As an example, a different voltage supply can be added to the circuit to provide a second source of a stress signal. In some examples, the stressing can applied such that a polarity of a natural bias of the HCI-SA PUF 300 circuit (e.g., a polarity of the output signal) can be changed to an opposite polarity. For instance, if the natural bias of the HCI-SA PUF 300 is such that the HCI-SA PUF 300 tends to resolve to a "10" prior to the application of the stress signal, then the stressing can change the output to a "10". 

[0072] In some implementations, the high voltage (V.sub.DDH) 434 may be connected to a single thick gate oxide PMOS transistor device P0 322 for each HCI-SA PUF circuit 300 in an array of HCI-SA PUF circuits 300. The thick gate oxide transistor device 322 can withstand a higher V.sub.GS without gate oxide breakdown and is a common process technology option because thick oxide devices are needed in the device pads. An amount of stress (e.g., a strength or extent of offset reinforcement) can be controlled by the pulse width and the voltage of V.sub.DDH 432. In some implementations, a supply of approximately 2.5-3V may be available on the substrate die as the input/output (I/O) pad supply and thus the offset reinforcement step 408 may not require a separate dedicated voltage supply. 

[0073] In a post-stress step 436, the HCI-SA PUF circuit 300 can be fired under normal operating conditions as shown. In particular, the INx1/INx2 signals 412 can be asserted to 1.2V (nominal 1V) and the HCIMODE signal 416 can be set to HCIMODE=0. The SAEN signal is asserted to fire the HCI-SA PUF circuit 300 and reinforced response signals out1/out2 424a can be obtained. The reinforced response signals out1/out2 424a can have a higher offset during post-stress normal operation than during pre-stress normal operation. 

[0074] In some examples, the HCI-SA PUF circuit 300 may undergo a one-time HCI response reinforcement step (e.g., step 408 of FIG. 4) immediately after manufacturing. This one-time step 408 may take a few tens of seconds of HCI response reinforcement stress resulting in a substantially permanent offset shift in each of the HCI-SA PUF circuits 300 in a direction determined by random process variations. After this one-time stress, the HCI-SA PUF circuit 300 can be used just as a regular PUF circuit by activating it in a normal operating mode. As such, the HCI response reinforcement technique can be applied to devices including such a HCI-SA PUF circuit 300 as an initial post-manufacturing step and devices in the field may not be subjected to any additional HCI response reinforcement stress. 

[0075] In some examples, the response reinforcement techniques described here can increase a reliability of the PUF circuit over multiple evaluations. For instance, a resulting change in the PUF circuit can result in an increase in reliability over multiple evaluations over circuit aging. In some examples, the techniques can increase a reliability of the PUF circuit across different voltage levels and temperatures. The response reinforcement process can be performed multiple times to reinforce a bias magnitude of the output signal over the life of the PUF circuit. The process can be performed multiple times to re-stress the PUF circuit to modify the bias magnitude over the life of the chip containing the PUF circuit. For instance, the process can also be performed multiple times to re-stress the PUF circuit to perform reliability over multiple applications (e.g., uses) of the PUF circuit over the life of the chip containing the PUF circuit. 

[0076] In some implementations, both transistor devices 220, 230 in the PUF circuit (e.g., PUF circuit 304 in FIG. 3) can be stressed by either equal amounts or different amounts. For example, threshold voltages of the transistor devices 220, 230 can be stressed based on different voltages, currents, durations, and/or directions. In the example of FIG. 3, the circuit of HCI-SA PUF circuit 300 can be modified to select both transistor devices 220, 230 (e.g., one at a time, or both simultaneously) to apply different levels of stress current, or for different durations, and/or in different directions. 

[0077] To demonstrate and evaluate the techniques described herein, an exemplar 5.5 mm.sup.2 full custom ASIC testchip in 65 nm bulk CMOS technology was designed and fabricated. The testchip included an HCI-SA PUF circuit (e.g., similar to the example HCI-SA PUF circuit 300 described above). On each chip, there were 3,200 HCI-SA PUF circuits in a total area of 0.32 mm.sup.2 that includes scan flops for testing. Each HCI-SA PUF circuit was laid out in an area of 20.8 .mu.m.sup.2 that includes one thick gate oxide PMOS per cell. The HCI-SAs were arranged in two arrays of 1,600 elements each. All 1,600 HCI-SA PUF circuit elements in an array were designed to share common IN1, IN2, and SAEN signals. The outputs were sent to flip-flops connected in a scan chain for easy read out. One array had the capability of self-contained offset reinforcement as described above. The other array was designed as a fail-safe and each HCI-SA PUF circuit element's reinforcement direction was loaded from a scan chain. However, the self-contained reinforcement circuits worked as designed and all results presented herein were measurements taken from those arrays. The chips were packaged in a 132-pin PGA package and tested using a custom designed 4-layer PCB. 

[0078] Using the testchip implementation described above, the following information was recorded: an HCI-SA PUF circuit element offset, reliability across environmental variations and aging, uniqueness, and randomness. The measurements were taken across a voltage range of .+-.20% of the nominal 1V VDD (e.g., 0.8V to 1.2V) and temperatures of -20.degree. C., 27.degree. C., and 85.degree. C. A TestEquity Model 107 temperature chamber was used to fully enclose the test PCB during temperature variation testing. 

[0079] The HCI-SA PUF circuits were incrementally stressed using 3V V.sub.DDH pulses of example width 1 s, 4 s, 20 s, and 100 s which resulted in a cumulative stress of 1 s, 5 s, 25 s, and 125 s. As described above, the 3V V.sub.DDH supply was connected to a thick gate oxide PMOS transistor per HCI-SA to avoid oxide breakdown of other devices in the circuit. Offset reinforcement requires firing the HCI response reinforcement aspect of the HCI-SA PUF circuit once (e.g., all can be fire together because SAEN, IN1, and IN2 can be shared across all HCI-SA PUF circuits in an array) in the normal mode followed by a pulse of high voltage at VDDH in the HCI stress mode. 

[0080] To evaluate an efficacy of HCI response reinforcement in altering the HCI-SA PUF circuit offset, an offset of each of the 1,600 HCI-SAs was measured before and after the HCI offset reinforcement. To measure the offset (either before or after HCI stress), the input differential (e.g., a voltage difference between IN1 and IN2) was swept from -400 mV to +400 mV in steps of 10 mV. At each step, the HCI-SA PUF circuits were fired multiple times. The outputs after every activation were read out of the output scan chain. These were then post-processed to measure the offset of each HCI-SA PUF circuit in the array. 

[0081] FIG. 5a shows the measured offset of all HCI-SA PUF circuits of a chip, before and after HCI response reinforcement stress, when arranged in order of their offset0 in ascending order. As expected, a shift in the offset was higher for longer stress durations. For example, for a 1 s stress, a shift in the offset was approximately 10-50 mV and for a stress of 125 s, the shift was approximately 150-300 mV. 

[0082] FIG. 5b shows the scatter plot 550 of the magnitude of the shift in offset (|.DELTA.offset|) vs. |offset0| for different stress durations. As expected, |.DELTA.offset| was higher for longer stress durations. For a Is stress, |.DELTA.offset| was approximately 10-50 mV and for a stress of 125 s, |.DELTA.offset| was approximately 150-300 mV. Moreover, on average (as shown by the bold lines 560 in FIG. 5b), |.DELTA.offset| was slightly larger for HCI-SA PUF circuits with low magnitude of offset0, which can be desirable because HCI-SA PUF circuits with low magnitudes of offset may need a larger shift for reliability. 

[0083] FIG. 6 shows a measured distribution 600 of the offset for one chip before and after HCI response reinforcement stress at 1.0V and 27.degree. C. The offset0 has a typical normal spread as expected. The mean was slightly skewed (.mu.0=-23 mV) and may be due to a layout systematic bias. The standard deviation of offset0 was 79 mV. After stress, the distribution splits into two groups. HCI-SA PUF circuits with negative offset0 have their offset shifted to the left (more negative) and HCI-SA PUF circuits with positive offset0 have their offset shifted to the right (more positive). A minimum magnitude of offset after stress of 1 s, 5 s, 25 s, and 125 s is 5 mV, 28 mV, 92 mV, and 158 mV respectively. 

[0084] FIGS. 5a and 6 show that HCI response reinforcement stress can increase offset in HCI-SA PUF circuits. Offset can be an indirect measure of reliability and PUF reliability can be directly measured by multiple evaluations across environmental variations and over aging. For direct measurement of reliability, the following can be performed: 

[0085] i. Perform 100 PUF evaluations at each possible combination of voltage (0.8V, 1.0V, 1.2V) and temperature (-20.degree. C., 27.degree. C., 85.degree. C.). Each PUF evaluation generates 1,600 response bits corresponding to the 1,600 HCI-SA PUF circuits elements in the array. A majority vote of the 100 responses at the nominal conditions (27.degree. C. and 1.0V) can be considered a golden response against which the response at other conditions may be compared. 

[0086] ii. At every combination of voltage and temperature, each of the 100 evaluations can be compared to the golden response. Error.sub.i,V1,T1 is defined as a number of bits out of the 1,600 HCI-SA PUF circuit outputs that do not match the golden response in the i.sup.th evaluation at voltage=V1 V and temperature=T.degree. C. 

[0087] iii. % errors are defined at a voltage-temperature combination (Error.sub.V1,T1) as the maximum Error.sub.i,V1,T1 across the 100 evaluations. The % errors across voltage-only variations (Error.sub.V only) is defined as a maximum errors across the 100 evaluations at all voltage variations and at nominal temperature e.g., maximum of Error.sub.0.8,27, Error.sub.1.0,27, and Error.sub.1.2,27. Similarly, % errors across temperature-only variations (Error.sub.T only) is defined as a maximum errors across the 100 evaluations at all temperature variations and at nominal voltage e.g., maximum of Error.sub.1.0,-20, Error.sub.1.0,27, and Error.sub.1.0,85. The overall % errors (Error.sub.V&T) is defined as a maximum errors across the 100 evaluations at all voltage and temperature combinations. Using this methodology, the reported % errors was the largest % of bits that were erroneous for any of the voltage/temperature conditions in any of the 100 PUF evaluations performed at that voltage/temperature. In other words, adding an ECC with the capability to correct that % of the bits could result in a perfect response (e.g., matching the golden response) at every evaluation. 

[0088] These measures of reliability were taken for an exemplar die before and after different stress durations. FIG. 7(a) is a histogram 700 showing an improvement in reliability for HCI-SA PUF circuits with different stress durations and when expressed as % errors. FIG. 7(b) is a histogram 750 showing the overall errors (across all voltage and temperature variations considered) reduce from 20.3% to 13.5%, 4.0%, 0.43%, and 0% when stressed for 1 s, 5 s, 25 s, and 125 s respectively. This means that with 125 s stress, there were no errors for any of the 1,600 HCI-SA PUF circuits across all of 100 evaluations at all voltage and temperature combinations. Variations in voltage have a stronger impact on reliability as compared to temperature variations. For temperature only variations, the % errors reduce from 3.8% to 1.4%, 0.19%, 0%, and 0% when stressed for 1 s, 5 s, 25 s, and 125 s respectively; and for voltage only variations, the % errors reduce from 16.5% to 10.6%, 3.1%, 0%, and 0% when stressed for 1 s, 5 s, 25 s, and 125 s respectively. FIG. 7(a) shows that highest number of errors are seen at low-temperature and low-voltage (0.8V and -20.degree. C.). 

[0089] To measure permanence of HCI-stress over aging, the reliability of a HCI-stressed chip is measured both before and after aging, and simulated in a shorter duration using elevated temperature and voltage. A chip is baked, originally stressed for 125 s, at 150% of nominal 1V (=1.5V) and 100.degree. C. for 93 hours, resulting in an acceleration factor of 161.4 and hence an aging of approximately 1.7 years for a chip operating at nominal conditions (1.0V and 27.degree. C.). Measurements showed 0% errors before and after accelerated aging, suggesting that the impact of HCI-stress is not significantly reversed with aging. 

[0090] Uniqueness is a measure of how uncorrelated the response bits are across chips, and ideally the response bits should differ with a probability of 0.5. The Hamming distance of a k-bit response from ideally unique chips should follow a binomial distribution with parameters N=k and p=0.5 and the mean of the HD distribution should be equal to k/2. In an example, 100 16-bit response words (i.e., k=16) are generated from the measured outputs of the 1600 HCI-SAs on three exemplar chips. These words are generated at 27.0 and 1.0V after the HCI-SAs have been stressed for 25 s. FIG. 8 is a histogram 800 shows that the pair-wise HD of response bits from the three chips is close to ideal with means of 7.32, 7.36, and 7.50. 

[0091] PUF randomness is a measure of the unpredictability of the response bits. In an ideal random response, the % 1's and % 0's in the response should be equal. In a measured response of 1600 HCI-SAs from three exemplar chips, after a 25 s stress, the % 1's are 60.6%, 63.6%, and 61.4% which corresponds to entropy of 0.967, 0.946, and 0.962 respectively. 

[0092] By using the HCI response reinforcement techniques described herein, a core PUF reliability can be enhanced thus reducing a strength of an error correction codes (ECC) function. As the ECC overheads (e.g., area, power, delay, and complexity) can scale quickly with the ECC strength, an overall PUF efficiency can be boosted by using the disclosed HCI response reinforcement techniques. While these methods can be used in applications requiring high PUF circuit reliability such as key generation, other applications can also benefit from improved PUF circuit reliability and efficiency. 

[0093] Other examples are within the scope and spirit of the description and claims. Additionally, certain functions described above can be implemented using software, hardware, firmware, hardwiring, or combinations of any of these. Features implementing functions may also be physically located at various positions, including being distributed such that portions of functions are implemented at different physical locations. The use of the term "a" herein and throughout the application is not used in a limiting manner and therefore is not meant to exclude a multiple meaning or a "one or more" meaning for the term "a." Additionally, to the extent priority is claimed to a provisional patent application, it should be understood that the provisional patent application is not limiting but includes examples of how the techniques described herein may be implemented. 

[0094] It will thus be seen that the objects set forth above, among those made apparent from the preceding description, are efficiently attained and, because certain changes may be made in carrying out the above method and in the construction(s) set forth without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description and shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.

Abstract
A highly articulated robotic probe (HARP) is comprised of a first mechanism and a second mechanism, one or both of which can be steered in desired directions. Each mechanism can alternate between being rigid and limp. In limp mode the mechanism is highly flexible. When one mechanism is limp, the other is rigid. The limp mechanism is then pushed or pulled along the rigid mechanism. The limp mechanism is made rigid, thereby assuming the shape of the rigid mechanism. The rigid mechanism is made limp and the process repeats. These innovations allow the device to drive anywhere in three dimensions. The device can "remember" its previous configurations, and can go anywhere in a body or other structure (e.g. jet engine). When used in medical applications, once the device arrives at a desired location, the inner core mechanism can be removed and another functional device such as a scalpel, clamp or other tool slid through the rigid sleeve to perform. Because of the rules governing abstracts, this abstract should not be used to construe the claims.

Description


[0001] The present application claims the benefit of U.S. application Ser. No. 60/583,094 entitled Flexible Steerable Go-Anywhere Medical Snake Robot filed Jun. 25, 2004, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference. 

BACKGROUND 

[0002] The present disclosure is an outgrowth from the field of robotics for the field of teleoperated mechanisms and, more particularly, to three dimensional, flexible, steerable devices. 

[0003] Although there are many applications for this disclosed device, the motivating application for this device is minimally invasive surgery. There are few medical robotic systems available in the market today. These systems can be categorized into three major groups: active, semi-active, and passive robotic system. The active robotic system approach is represented by Kazanzides et al. [Kazanzides P, Mittelstadt B, Musits B, Barger W, Zuhars J, Williamson B, Cain P and Carbone E: An integrated system for cementless hip replacement. IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology. pp. 307-313, 1995] and Brandt et al. [Brandt G, Radermacher K, Lavalle S, Staudte H. W, Rau G, "A Compact Robot for Image Guided Orthopedic Surgery: Concept and Preliminary Results", Lecture notes in Computer Science 1205, CVRMed-MRCAS'97, Troccaz J, Grimson R, and Mosges R, eds, pp. 767-776, 1997] where, in the first example, a serial robot actively mills the femur to optimally fit an implant for a knee surgery. This robot is a serial-type mechanism with a large work volume relative to the task at hand. Therefore, such robots are somewhat cumbersome and heavy, and suffer several known drawbacks including relatively low stiffness and accuracy, and low nominal load/weight ratio. The fact that these robots are used for medical procedures, where accuracy and safety are paramount, has motivated researchers to look for manipulators with better kinematics and dynamic performance for specific surgical tasks. 

[0004] In the second example, a Stewart platform is used in hip replacement surgery. A Stewart platform is a type of parallel robot. A six degree of freedom parallel robot is composed of two rigid platforms, one used as a base platform and the other as a moving end-effecter. The two platforms are connected by ball-and socket joints to six links capable of changing their length. By controlling the length of each link, the mechanism can position and orient the moving end-effecter relative to the base platform. Advantages of parallel robotic structures include: low weight, compact structure, high accuracy, high stiffness, restricted workspace, high frequency response, and low cost. [Merlet J.-P., Les Robots Paralleles, Hermes, Paris, 1997]. Moreover, parallel robots are significantly more robust to failure than serial devices because in a serial device, one failure can cause the robot to dramatically move, whereas in a parallel structure, one failure will have little effect on the overall motion of the robot. This is important in medical applications because surgeons want the device to maintain its last position in case of a catastrophic failure. [Khodabandehloo K., Brett P. N., Buckingham R. O., "Special-Purpose Actuators and Architectures for Surgery Robots", Computer Integrated Surgery, Taylor R., Lavalle S., Burdea G., Ralph Mosges, eds, pp. 263-274, 1996]. 

[0005] From a robotics perspective, the main drawback of parallel mechanisms is their limited workspace. However, as pointed out by Khodabandehloo et al., limited workspace is an advantage in medical applications because the active in-situ operation volumes are limited to protect the patient and physician. Unfortunately, this advantage forces the robot to be deployed near the operation site in the operating room, which is often unrealistic because the robot would interfere with the surgeons. One of the solutions introduced to solve this problem is to attach the entire robotic system to the operating room's ceiling so that the robot works "upside down." [Lueth T., Bier J., "Robot Assisted Intervention in Surgery", Gilsbach J. M. and Stiel H. S. (Editors), Neuronavigation-Neurosurgical and Computer Scientific Aspects, Springer-Verlag, Wien. 1999]. In this way, the robot does not interfere during the standard operating procedure, and is activated and maneuvered to the operating area when required. However, this solution is not applicable in all operating rooms and requires special operating room design. 

[0006] The first known robot introduced to the operating room was the Robodoc.TM. system (Integrated Surgical Systems, Sacramento, Calif.). This robot is used to bore the medullary cavity of the femur for cementless femoral prostheses. Other robotic systems introduced in the market are the URS.TM., for positioning an endoscope in a tremor free and more precise way, i.e. with an accuracy of up to 1/100 mm. EndoAssist.TM., used for camera support, EndoWrist.TM., used for instrument support, CASPAR.TM., used for hip replacement, AESOP.TM., used for camera support, and ZEUS.TM., for instrument support. Other available medical robotic systems are the Neuromate.TM., used for endoscope/catheter guidance, the MKM.TM., used for microscope support, and the SurgiScope.TM., also used for microscope support. 

[0007] The semi-active robotic system approach is represented by Ho et al. [Ho S C, Hibberd R D, Davies B L, "Robot Assisted Knee Surgery", IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology, Vol. 14, pp. 292-299, May/June 1995], Kienzle et al. [Kienzle III, T, Stullberg D., Peshkin M., Quaid A., Lea J., Goswami A., Wu Ch., "A Computer-Assisted Total Knee Replacement Surgical System Using a Calibrated Robot", In Computer integrated surgery. Tatlor, Lavallee, Burdea, and Mosges, eds, MIT Press, pp. 410-416, 1996], and Harris et al. [Harris S J., Lin W J, Fan K L, Hibberd R D, Cobb J, Middelton R, Davies B L, "Experiences with Robotic Systems for Knee Surgery", Lecture notes in computer science 1205, CVRMed-MRCASD 97]. In Kienzle et al. the robot acts as an assistant during the operation by holding a tool in a steady position, accurately guiding a cutting tool, and preventing the tool from moving out of the desired operative region. A third approach, passive robotic systems, is represented by Grace et al. [Grace K. W., Colgate J. E., Gluksberg M. R., Chun J. H., "Six Degree of Freedom Micromanipulator for Ophthalmic Surgery", IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 630-635, 1993, and Jensen et al. [Jensen P. S., Glucksberg M. R., Colgate J. E., Grace K. W., Attariwala R., "Robotic Micromanipulator for Orthopedic Surgery", 1.sup.st International Symposium on Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery, pp. 204-210, Pittsburgh 22-24, 1994], where a six degree of freedom robot acts simply as a guided tool, fully controlled by the surgeon. 

[0008] The third category of medical robots is the passive system. This kind of robotic system supports the surgical procedure, but takes no active part during surgery, in other words: the surgeon is in full control of the surgical procedure at all times. There are also few robotic systems which fall in this category. Matsen et. al. [Matsen F A III, Garbini J L, Sidles J A, Prat B, Baumgarten D, Kaiura R, Robotic assistance in Orthopedic surgery, Clin Orthp and Rela Res 296, 1993: 178-186.] report on a passive robotic system for knee arthroplasty. For their research they use a commercial Unimation PUMA 260, who hold a three dimensional transparent template which enables the surgeon to indicate the desired position of the prosthetic joint surface. The robot then places the saw guide such that the resulting cut plane agrees with the one indicated by the surgeon, who is actually the one holding the power saw and performing the cuts. This system was never used in the operating room. 

[0009] McEwen et. al. [Mc Ewen C, Bussani C R, Auchinleck G F, Breault M J Development and initial clinical evaluation of pre robotic and robotic retraction systems for surgery. 2.sup.nd Annual Int Symposium Custom Orthopaedic Prosthetics, Chicago, October 1989.] use Arthrobot as an assistant in the operating room. The robot is neumatically powered, electronically controlled positioner device which is used intraoperatively to hold the limb. The system has no sensing capabilities and is able to move only under explicit human control. The system was used during arthroplasties of the knee and hip. 

[0010] Other passive robotic systems are reported by Grace et. al. [Grace K. W., Colgate J. E., Gluksberg M. R., Chun J. H. A Six Degree of Freedom Micromanipulator for Ophthalmic Surgery. IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation 1993; 630-635.] yet these are not related to orthopedic applications. Grace developed a six degrees of freedom micro manipulator which is used for treatment of retinal venous occlusion. During procedure, the operator is watching the robot's end-effector (using a microscop) and guiding it using a multi-dimensional joystick input device. 

[0011] However, the most frequent examples of passive robotic systems are surgical navigation systems, as they represent the central element in each CAOS system [Nolte L P, Langlotz F, Basics of computer assisted orthopedic surgery (CAOS), Navigation and robotics in total joint and spine surgery, New York, Springer, 2004.] Basically, a navigation system refers the position i.e. location and orientation, of the acting components of the system to a global coordinate system, such that their relative position can be resolved in the global system. 

[0012] The inventors of the current patent application have built many other types of robots. One of their specialties includes snake robots, formally called hyper redundant mechanisms. Snake robots can be used in an active, semi-active, and passive manner. The snake robot was designed and constructed originally to assist in search and rescue tasks. [Wolf, A, Brown, H. B., Casciola, R., Costa, A., Schwerin, M., Shamas, E., Choset, H., "A mobile hyper redundant mechanism for search and rescue tasks", Proceedings of IEEE/RSJ IROS2003]. The construction of this robot required a new mechanical design such that the robot would be stiff enough to support its own mass while consuming a minimum of power and volume. The new joints in this robot, designed and constructed in-house, have a large range of motion suitable for a hyper-redundant snake. [Shammas, E., Wolf, A., Brown, H. B., Choset, H., "New Joint Design for Three-dimensional Hyper Redundant Robots", Proceedings of IEEE/RSJ IROS2003]. The snake robot was attached on top of a mobile platform so that the snake could be semi-autonomously transported to the search area. Control of the mobile robot platform and the snake robot is performed through a joystick, to provide the user with a simple, intuitive interface. Snake robot control is performed within the reference frame of the camera, such that inputs from the joystick are converted into the camera reference frame. [Wolf, A, Choset, H., Brown, H. B., Casciola, R., "Design and Control of a Hyper-Redundant Mechanism", Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics]. If this type of device can be built with a reduced cross-sectional diameter, then this type of snake robot can also be used to allow surgeons to reach areas of the body in a minimally invasive fashion and to perform operations with tools at the tip of the snake robot. 

[0013] Virtually all previous work in hyper redundant robots focused on the mechanism development and end effecter placement. [Chirikjian G., S., Burdick W., J., (1995a) Kinematically optimal hyper-redundant manipulator configurations, IEEE Tran. On Rob and Aut, 11 (6), pp. 794-806][Chirikjian G., S., Burdick W., J. (1995b) The kinematic of hyper-redundant robot locomotion, IEEE Tran. On Rob and Aut, 11(6), pp. 781-793] Most of these devices were limited to the large scale. Historically, Hirose, in 1972, developed an impressive device that mimicked the locomotion of real snakes on the ground [Hirose, S. Biologically Inspired Robots: Snake-like Locomotors and Manipulators. Oxford University Press: Oxford 1993]. Research continued in the early 1990's at Caltech with the planar hyper-redundant manipulator by Chirikjian and Burdick; their contribution focused on novel end effecter placement algorithms for these robots, not the robot itself (Chirikjian and Burdick, 1995). Recently, other researchers, such as Yim at Xerox Parc, Miller on his own and Haith at NASA Ames, have duplicated Hirose's pioneering work on snake locomotion, where Yim and Haith used Yim's polybot modules to form modular hyper-redundant mechanisms. Modularity clearly has its benefits, but comes at an unacceptable cost, which manifests itself in a loss of strength and maneuverability. The electro-mechanical connection is polybot's innovation, but it also provides a point of weakness to the mechanism and it occupies space that makes the robot more discrete (increase in link length, i.e., separation in degrees of freedom (DOF)) and hence reduces maneuverability. Modularity has more value when the target configuration of the robot is unknown a priori. 

[0014] The challenge of a hyper redundant mechanism is to be strong enough to lift itself in three dimensions but be small and light enough to be useful to even demonstrate basic planning. The Pacific Northwest Labs developed a three-dimensional mechanism which was incredibly strong but moved too slowly and was too large. This robot moved too slowly because it was intended to be used for bomb disarming, so that a technician could tele-operate this robot to probe the internals of a bomb without accidentally detonating it. Kinematically, the mechanism is a sequence of linearly actuated universal joints stacked on top of each other. Takanashi developed at NEC a new two-DOF joint for snake robots that allowed a more compact design. This joint used a passive universal joint to prevent adjacent bays from twisting while at the same time allowing two degrees of freedom: bending and orienting. This universal joint enveloped an angular swivel joint, which provided the two degrees of freedom. The universal joint being installed on the outside rendered the joint too bulky. Researchers at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) "inverted" Takanashi's design by placing a small universal joint in the interior of the robot. This allowed for a more compact design, but came at the cost of strength and stiffness (backlash). A small universal joint cannot transmit rotational motion at big deflection angles nor can it withstand heavy loads. 

[0015] For certain applications it is desired that the hyper redundant robot operate on the size of less than 15 mm diameter that is normally required for minimally invasive surgery. The many degrees of articulation that furnish the hyper redundant robot with its enhanced capabilities also offer its main research challenges. There are several critical challenges that one must address to build a hyper redundant robot. First, there is the actual mechanical design itself; constructing a device that has high maneuverability in a small confined volume. Low level control is another challenge in such small scales. The compact space inside the device envelop leaves little room for wiring all actuators and sensors on board the hyper redundant robot, hence a more advanced low level controller should be used. 

[0016] One avenue of research to reduce the size of hyper redundant robots has focused on exotic actuator development such as shape memory alloys. Numerous works have been presented on active catheters and endoscopes, most actuated by shape memory alloys (SMA) actuators (Tohuko University, Olympus Optical Co). SMA spring and wire actuation has been implemented by Hirose [Hirose, S. Biologically Inspired Robots: Snake-like Locomotors and Manipulators. Oxford University Press: Oxford 1993] to overcome hysteresis problem of the SMA material. The Santa Anna laboratory in Pisa Italy (Dario et. al 2000), developed an arthroscope tool which is cable actuated; a position sensor detects the tip location and a force sensor detects contact forces. Overall accuracy of the device is 2.3 mm. Other endoscope like active mechanisms are the Laboratorie de Robotque de Paris (LRP), 8 mm in diameter worm like mechanism which is formed by a sequence of segments articulated to each other by SMA actuated pin joints [Kuhl C., Dumont G., Virtual endoscopy: from simulation to optimization of an active endoscope. Proc. Of the modeling & simulation for computer aided medicine and surgery 2002, 12, pp 84-93]. The device is specifically designed to explore the intestine with a camera. An electrostrictive polymer artificial muscle (EPAM) based snake like endoscopic robot was developed at Stanford Research Institute (SRI). That device is composed of several blocks joined by a concentric spine [Kombluh R D., Pelrine R., Eckerle J., Joseph J., Electrostrictive polymer artificial muscle actuators. Proc. Of the IEEE in Conf. on Robotics and Automation 1998, pp 2147-2154]. Researchers at Pennsylvania state university [Frecker M I., Aguilera W M., Analytical modeling of a segmented unimorph actuator using electroactive (pvdf-trfe) copolymer. Smart material and structures 2003, pp82-91] have also developed a snake like manipulator using electrostrictive polymer artificial muscle. Their special design of the actuator allows control of the curvature. 

[0017] As an alternative to an articulated probe, researchers have considered a mobile type of robot that resembles a miniature inch worm for both pipe inspection and medical procedures. Several manuscripts have been published regarding miniature inchworm-like mechanisms which are capable of maneuvering within rigid pipes. The Kato device [Kato S., Hirayama T., Fabrication of a high speed in-pipe mobile micro machine. Proc. of the 4.sup.th Japan-France Congress and 2.sup.th Japan-Europe congress on Mechatronics, 1998, 1, pp 429-432] is a 96 mm long, 18 mm in diameter mechanism which is capable of moving inside tubes using stick and slip strategy. This mechanism is not designed to move itself within a deformable environment (intestine). The walking work by Sanata Anna University is a 90 mm long, 18 mm in diameter SMA based worm like manipulator which clamps itself into the environment and then manipulates itself forward [Dario P., Menciassi A., Park J H., Lee L., Gorinil S., Park J., Robotic solutions and mechanisms for a semi-automated endoscope. Proc. of the IEEE/RSJ international conf. on robotic systems, 2002, p. 1379-1384. 

[0018] Focusing now on basic research specific to medical articulated probes, in Geunbae L., Kazuyuki M., Keisuke Y., Masahisa S., et. al (1996) Multi-link active catheter snake-like robot, Robotica, 14, pp. 499-506, the researchers developed a 2.8 mm diameter active catheter based on silicon micromachining. This multilane manipulator is connected by joints made of shape memory actuators (SMA), fixed at equilateral triangular locations to allow bending in several directions. In this design an indirect heating was developed due to the SMA when the control system was integrated into the manipulator. Other endoscopic, SMA based, tools are presented in [Nakamura Y., Matsui A., Saito T., Yoshimoto K., (1995) Shape-memory-alloys active forceps for laparoscopic surgery, IEEE int. Cof. on Robotics ad Automation, pp. 2320-2327]; [Ikuta K., Tsukamoto M., Hirose S., (1988) Shape memory alloys servo actuator system with electric resistance feedback and application for active endoscope, Proc. Of IEEE Int. Conf. Rob. And Aut. pp. 427-430]; [Ikuta K, Nolata M., Aritomi S., (1994a) Hyper redundant active endoscope for minimally invasive surgery, Proc. Of the first symposium on medical robotics and computer assisted surgery, Pittsburgh, Pa., pp. 230-237]; [Ikuta K., Nokata M., Aritomi S., (1994b) Biomedical micro robot driven by miniature cybernetic actuator, IEEE Int. Workshop on MEMS, pp. 263-268]; [Dario P., Carrozza M. C., Lencioni L., Magnani B., et. al, (1997a) A micro robotic system for colonoscopy, Proc. Int. Conf Rob. and Aut. pp. 1567-1572]; [Reynaerts D., Peirs J., Van Brussel H., (1999) Shape memory micro-actuation for a gastro intestinal intervention system. Sensor and actuators, 77, pp. 157-166]. However, those tools have relatively low stiffness, and they require high activation voltage. Hence, heat removal becomes a challenge. A different activation concept is presented in [Piers J., Reynaerts H., Van Brussel H., De Gersem G., (2003) Design of and advanced tool guiding system for robotic surgery, IEEE Int. Conf. Rob and Aut, pp. 2651-2656]. In that work, the authors presented a 5 mm diameter wire driven two degrees of freedom snake robot tool using super-elastic NiTi [Simaan N., Taylor R., and Flint P., (2004) A Dextrous System for Laryngeal Surgery: Multi-Backbone Bending Snake-Like Robot for Dexterous Surgical Tool Manipulation. IEEE Transaction of ICRA 2004, New Orleans]. Other devices are reported in Reynaerts D., Peiers L., Van Brussel H., Design of a shape memory actuated gastrointestine intervention system. Proc. of the int. Cof. of new actuation 1997, Epacenet mechanism and Young M L., Jinhee L., Jisang P., Byugkyu K., Jong Oh P., Soo Hyun K., Yeh-Sun H., Self propelling endoscopic system. Proc. of the 2001 IEEE/RSJ Int. Conf. on intelligent robotic systems. 2002, pp 117-1122. However, wire actuation, SMA, and EPAM actuation become challenges with robots having multiple degrees of freedom due to minimal space inside the robot's mechanical envelope. Therefore, most of these systems were developed to be introduced into a confined tube-like environment or work as bending mechanisms not capable of generating a 3D curve (e.g. double non-planar "S" shape). 

[0019] Robert Sturges' U.S. Pat. No. 5,759,151, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, discloses a flexible, steerable device for conducting exploratory procedures. The device includes at least one spine, each having stiffening means for selectively rendering the spine rigid and flexible along its length. A flexible sheath surrounds the spine and is axially slidably moveable relative to the spine so that the sheath will follow and conform to the shape of a spine in the rigid state and resist further flexure when the spine is in a relaxed state. A steerable distal tip is provided on the distal end of the device. Controls for the distal tip are mounted on the proximal end of the device. Mechanisms are provided on the distal end of the device for selectively activating and deactivating the stiffening means of the spine. An instrument conduit may be mounted on the sheath. 

[0020] U.S. Pat. No. 6,610,007 discloses a steerable endoscope having an elongated body with a selectively steerable distal portion and an automatically controlled proximal portion. The endoscope body is inserted into a patient and the selectively steerable distal portion is used to select a desired path within the patient's body. When the endoscope body is advanced, an electronic motion controller operates the automatically controlled proximal portion to assume the selected curve of the selectively steerable distal portion. Another desired path is selected with the selectively steerable distal portion and the endoscope body is advanced again. As the endoscope body is further advanced, the selected curves propagate proximally along the endoscope body, and when the endoscope body is withdrawn proximally, the selected curves propagate distally along the endoscope body. This creates a serpentine motion in the endoscope body allowing it to negotiate tortuous curves along a desired path through or around and between organs within the body.

DESCRIPTION 

[0045] A highly articulated robotic probe (HARP) 10 of one embodiment of the present disclosure shown in FIGS. 1A-1C is essentially two concentric mechanisms, an outer one and an inner one, each of which can be viewed as a steerable mechanism. FIGS. 1A-1C show the concept of how different embodiments of the HARP 10 operate. Referring to FIG.1A, we call the inner mechanism a first mechanism or inner core mechanism 12. We call the outer mechanism a second mechanism or sleeve mechanism 14. Each mechanism can alternate between being rigid and limp. In the rigid mode or state, the mechanism is just that--rigid. In the limp mode or state, the mechanism is highly flexible and thus either assumes the shape of its surroundings or can be reshaped. It should be noted that the term "limp" as used herein does not denote a structure that passively assumes a particular configuration dependent upon gravity and the shape of its environment; rather, the "limp" structures described in this application are capable of assuming positions and configurations that are desired by the operator of the device, and therefore are articulated and controlled rather than flaccid and passive. 

[0046] With this HARP 10, one mechanism starts limp and the other starts rigid. For the sake of explanation, assume the sleeve 14 is rigid and the core 12 is limp, as seen in step 1 in FIG. 1A. Now, the core 12 is both pushed forward by a feeding mechanism 16, described below, and its "head" or distal end is steered, as seen in step 2 in FIG. 1A. Now, the core 12 is made rigid and the sleeve 14 is made limp. The sleeve 14 is then pushed forward until it catches up or is coextensive with the core 12, as seen in step 3 in FIG. 1A. Now, the sleeve 14 is made rigid, the core 12 limp, and the procedure then procedure repeats. One variation of this approach is to have the sleeve 14 be steerable as well. The operation of such a device is illustrated in FIG. 1B. In FIG. 1B it is seen that each mechanism is capable of catching up to the other and then advancing one link beyond. That requires an additional camera on the sleeve 14 but would potentially allow for quicker deployment of the HARP 10. In the current rendition, the sleeve 14 is steerable and the core 12 is not. The operation of such a device is shown in FIG. 1C. 

[0047] In medical applications, once the HARP 10 arrives at a desired location, the surgeon can remove the inner core 12 and slide either a conventional device or a custom tool through the rigid sleeve 14 to perform various operations. 

[0048] The HARP 10 is not limited to surgery, but can be used in engine inspection, engine repairs, and engine retrofitting. Other applications include tank inspection, spying or surveillance applications, bomb disarming, and inspection or repairs in tightly confined spaces such as submarines or within nuclear weapons. Other applications include structural (e.g. building) inspections, hazardous waste remediation and bioterrorists sample recovery. Clearly, the device of the present disclosure has a wide variety of applications and should not be taken as being limited to any particular application. 

[0049] The HARP 10 of the present disclosure device bears some similarities to Bob Sturges' patented device (U.S. Pat. No. 5,759,151) although the present disclosure incorporates several major innovations. First, the core 12 and/or sleeve 14 is steerable. Second, the sleeve 14 can be made both rigid and limp. These two innovations allow the HARP 10 to drive anywhere in three-dimensions. Sturges' device assumes that it is moving through a tubular space, such as the large intestines. Sturges' device requires that the intestines shape the device as it goes. As Sturges' device propagates out it, cannot "remember" its previous configuration and hence cannot keep the path it followed due to the fact that it is composed of only one element that can become both rigid and stiff. The HARP 10 can "remember" its previous configurations and for this reason, the HARP 10 can go anywhere in a three dimensional volume such as the intracavity spaces in a body. FIGS. 2A-2D illustrate various configurations assumed by a prototype of the device 10. 

[0050] The following discussion contains details of a preferred embodiment. The reader should recognize that the present disclosure is not to be limited by the detailed information that follows. Rather, the detailed information is intended for purposes of illustration and not limitation. As can be seen in FIGS. 3A-3D and 4A and 4B the sleeve 14 and core 12, respectively, are made up in this embodiment of concentric cylinders 22, 24, respectively, although links of other shapes may be used, e.g. a dogbone configuration (not shown) as well as links of a type that are not concentric, e.g. backbone configuration (see FIG. 17), among others. The ends of the cylinders 22, 24 are not flat but instead one end 26 is an "outer" or convex hemisphere and the other end 28 is an "inner" or concave hemisphere, both with the same radius of curvature R. The cylinders 22, or links, of the outer sleeve 14 are "chained" back-to-back such that the concave end 28 of one mates with the convex end 26 of an adjacent cylinder. Similarly, the cylinders 24, or links, of the inner core 12 are chained back-to-back. The result is a spherical-like joint, from a kinematic point of view. In the current embodiment, each link is able to rotate on the adjacent link's head, acting as a spherical joint with approximately 14.degree. range of motion in any direction, although other ranges of motion are possible. The cylinders 22 have three channels 30 extending therethrough for control wires. 

[0051] FIGS. 5A and 5B illustrate another embodiment in which the core 14 is steerable. The core 14 of this embodiment is comprised of cylinders 24' which have a convex 26 and concave 28 end. However, the cylinders 24' have three channels 32 for control wires. 

[0052] The heads (i.e. the distal cylinders) of both the sleeve 14 and the core 12 are steerable using three cables which are attached at, for example, 120.degree. from each other. As can be seen in FIGS. 3A-3D and FIGS. 5A-5D, there are three small cylindrical channels 30, 32, respectively, for wires to pass through. In the version of the device shown in FIG. 4A and 4B, the inner cylinder 24 has only one wire, in which case there is only one hole 34 through its center. 

[0053] It will be appreciated that although the preferred embodiment described above utilizes cables or wires, alternative means of manipulating the limp elements, such as miniature pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders or other mechanical linkages situated between individual links, can be employed without falling outside the scope of this invention. 

[0054] The links, and hence the HARP 10, can be made out of virtually any material, including plastic, which allows it to be used online with NMR. One current prototype of our device has an outer diameter of the outer sleeve 14 of 12 mm and an outer diameter of the inner core 12 of 6 mm. The choice of 12 mm is based on available port sizes. Each link of the outer sleeve 14 weighs 1.5 grams and each link of the inner core 12 weighs 0.5 grams. Currently, the number of links in each of the inner core 12 and outer sleeve 14 is seventeen. Therefore, the total weight of the device 10 is thirty-four grams and its total length is 300 mm. These dimensions are intended for purposes of illustration and not limitation. 

[0055] As noted, the core 12 and sleeve 14 can be made rigid or limp using wires or cables. Although there are many variations, in the current prototype the outer sleeve 14 consists of a set of cylinders 22 strung on three wires. The three wires are 120.degree. apart, making it possible to steer in any direction. This design provides a radius of curvature of approximately eight centimeters. When the wires are pulled towards the back of the sleeve 14, the cylinders 22 are pulled towards each other. When the pulling force increases, the friction force between adjacent cylinders 22 increases until the whole outer sleeve 14 stiffens (i.e. enters the rigid mode). When the pulling force is released, the outer sleeve 14 becomes limp. Thus, the wires together with their respective motors form a locking device. The motors, along with the electronics for controlling the motors, form a means for controlling the tension on the wire. When the outer sleeve 14 is positioned one cylinder in front of the inner core 12, and the inner core 12 is stiff, the distal link of the outer sleeve 14 can be oriented by pulling one or more of the three wires. The magnitude of the pulling force which is exerted on each wire can be controlled. By pulling the three wires with the same magnitude, the outer sleeve 14 becomes stiff without changing its shape. 

[0056] The inner core 12, like the outer sleeve 14, consists of a set of cylinders. In contrast to the outer sleeve 14, the inner core 12 does not need (but may optionally have) a steering ability. The inner core 12 does need the ability to change from rigid mode, to limp mode, and back. Therefore, in embodiments where the inner core 12 need not be steerable, the links of the inner core 12 may be strung on a single wire, which enables a small diameter for the device 10. 

[0057] One type of feeding mechanism 16, shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B, inserts and retracts the HARP 10 into and out of, respectively, a region of interest. The feeder 16 has two movable carts. A first cart 42, carried in a first fixed tray 43, drives the outer sleeve 14 while a second cart 44 carried in a second fixed tray 45 drives the inner core 12. Each cart 42, 44, and hence each of the inner core 12 and outer sleeve 14, is driven independently by separate linear actuators 46, 48 respectively. The linear actuators 46, 48 may carry shaft encoders (not shown) used for position control as is known. 

[0058] Each of the carts 42, 44 carries one or more motors necessary for controlling the wires of the inner core 12 and outer sleeve 14. For example, as seen in FIG. 7 and FIG. 8, the cart 42 carries motors 50, 51, 52 which control the tension on wires 54, 55, 56 of outer sleeve 14. As shown in FIG. 9, second cart 44 has a motor 58 for controlling the tension on wire 59 of the inner core 12. Each of the motors 50, 51, 52 and 58 may be provided with shaft encoders (not shown) used for position control as is known. If the inner core 12 were to also be steerable, it too would require three motors. 

[0059] For the 12 mm diameter HARP 10, the feeder's 16 dimensions are 400 mm (long) by 100 mm (width/height), while the HARP is 300 mm long. The 12 mm prototype HARP 10 is inserted into a protective plastic bag to achieve sterility. However, the device can be constructed out of inexpensive ABS plastic rendering the device disposable. 

[0060] We selected motors to handle the "worst case" configuration for the device, i.e. when the motors tensioning the wires have to exert the most torque. The "worst case" configuration is when the HARP 10 is stretched out in a cantilever position, the outer sleeve 14 is limp, and the inner core 12 supports its own weight as well as the weight of the outer sleeve 14. 

[0061] To estimate the axial force needed to be applied by the wire 59 of the inner core 12 to support this configuration, we use a simplified model of this extreme configuration. The simplified model is shown in FIGS. 10A-10C where we approximate the system parameters as follows: outer sleeve cylinder weight as 1.5 grams, inner sleeve cylinder weight as 0.5 grams, and the number of cylinders in each is seventeen. Therefore, the total weight of the device is thirty-four grams and its total length is 300 mm. Finally, the outer diameter of the outer sleeve 14 is 12 mm and the outer diameter of the inner core 12 is 6 mm. The choice of 12 mm is based on available ports and the 6 mm follows by design. 

[0062] The weight of the device is simplified to a point mass at the center of gravity of the device. The largest torque is exerted on the area between the two proximal cylinders of the HARP 10. Therefore we developed a simplified model to include only one long cylinder that is in contact with the proximal cylinder. The wire of the inner core is applied with an axial force, F, at the center of the HARP 10. A free body diagram of the simplified model is shown in FIG. 10C. 

[0063] The approximated relation between the force F and the torque .tau. applied on a circular surface with radius r and friction coefficient .mu. is shown in equation (1). 

.tau. = .mu. F r F = .tau. .mu. r = 50 N mm .mu. 3 mm .apprxeq. 17 N .mu. ( 1 ) ##EQU00001## 

It is clear from equation (1) that the friction coefficient is an important design criteria. When the friction between cylinders is low, the pulling force that is needed to withstand the mechanism's own weight is enormous. To fmd the accurate friction coefficient between cylinders some empirical tests were needed. 

[0064] Three different materials were tested: Aluminum T6061-T6, Garolite.RTM. G11/FR5 and Garolite.RTM. G10FR4. The aluminum and Garolite.RTM. G11FR5 had a friction coefficient of approximately 0.2-0.3, but after a few minutes of being rotated under load, the contact surface was polished and smoothed out, and the friction coefficient dropped dramatically making these materials unfit for our design. The Garolite.RTM. G10FR4, which is a high pressure laminated glass reinforced epoxy, has a very high friction coefficient (approximately 0.5) and was durable to polishing. This material is also MRI compatible. 

[0065] Based on these tests, we decided to use the Garolite.RTM. G10/FR4. This material enabled the use of reasonable pulling force of the wire (approximately 35-40 N) to hold the weight of the entire device in the extreme configuration described above. Furthermore, this pulling force was sufficient to withstand additional torques caused by steering the distal link of the outer sleeve. 

[0066] An implication of using the Garolite.RTM. G10FR4 was the need for a non-abrasive wire. Therefore we used the Spectra polyethylene fiber wire, with 0.030'' diameter, a breaking force of 150 lbf, and a low stretch (about 3%). An additional advantage of the Spectra.RTM. wire is its very tight radius curvature that enabled the use of a small diameter pulley (4 mm diameter) making it possible to achieve a high pulling force per torque. 

[0067] FIG. 11 is a block diagram illustrating the components of a control system and the flow of information between those components. The feeding mechanism 16 interfaces with a control computer 62 through a bus conversion module 64. In the present embodiment, the conversion module 64 converts USB to I.sup.2C and back again. Outgoing data from the feeding mechanism 16 is input to the module 64 for conversion to the USB and is then input to a USB port 66 on the computer 62. Incoming data to control software 68 may include motor current data and motor encoder data for each of the motors in the feeding mechanism 16. Joystick data (position data) may also be received from a joystick 70. A monitor 72 may be responsive to video data from a camera mounted on the distal end of the outer sleeve 12 and/or inner core 14 to provide visual feedback to a user regarding the position of the distal end of the HARP 10. The control software 68 may output motor current limit commands and motor position commands which are input to the feeding mechanism 16. 

[0068] FIG. 12 is a block diagram of an exemplary electrical system which may be used for the feeding mechanism 16. A plurality of PID motor controllers 74 are used to control the various linear actuators 46, 48 and motors 50, 51, 52, 58. An example of one of the PID motor controllers 74 is shown in detail in FIGS. 13A, 13B and 13C. The PID motor controller 74 is built around a PIC 18F series microcontroller 95. The motor controller 74 also features a quadrature decoder chip 96, an H-bridge chip 97, and a quad op-amp chip (TLV2374-lPW) having four amplifiers 98, 99, 100 and 101. The controller 74 also features a number of discrete components in support of these integrated circuits as well as three connectors, one connector 103 for the motor, and the other two connectors 104, 105 to create a stacking bus structure. 

[0069] The quadrature chip 96 decodes the two channel encoder data from a motor encoder and outputs up and down clocks which are fed into the microcontroller 95. The microcontroller 95 uses its counter circuits to count the forward and reverse movements of the motor shaft to calculate the current position of the motor shaft. 

[0070] The H-bridge chip 97 is used to drive the motor. This chip takes a PWM signal and a direction signal as input from the microcontroller 95 and switches the motor on and off according to these signals. This chip handles the higher currents and voltages required by the motor which are beyond the capabilities of the microcontroller 95 outputs. 

[0071] The third chip is the quad op-amp. This chip is used entirely for motor current monitoring. One amplifier 98 is used in a non-inverting configuration with a gain of 74.2 with its output fed to one of the microcontroller's 95 analog to digital pins. A second amplifier 99 is configured as a non-inverting amplifier with a gain of 500 and is also connected to an analog to digital pin of the microcontroller 95. This higher gain gives a more precise current measurement at lower current values. A third amplifier 100 is used to control a current source which drives an LED with current proportional to the motor current. This, along with an LED which indicates the direction of motion, gives the operator a clear visual indication of what the controller 74 is doing. 

[0072] The microcontroller (PIC) 95 is the heart of this board. This chip features an I.sup.2C bus peripheral which is used for communication with the host computer 62. This is a two way link used to send commands from the computer 62 to the controller 74, while status information flows back from the controller 74 to the computer 62. The commands from the computer 62 are related to position goals and current limits. The status sent back to the computer 62 includes motor electrical current measurements and motor encoder values. 

[0073] The primary role of the microcontroller 95 is to run a PID position control loop. The purpose of this PID loop is to minimize the error between the motor encoder count and a dynamically generated position goal. This position goal is generated by another component of the microcontroller program, the trajectory generation system. 

[0074] The trajectory generation system of controller 74 creates goals based on a final goal supplied over the I.sup.2C bus, and a desired time-to-goal value also supplied over the I.sup.2C bus, as is known in the art. The trajectory generator uses these values to create a trapezoidal velocity profile to bring the motor to the desired final position in the specified amount of time. This working goal is updated at approximately 1 kHz, which is also the frequency of the PID loop. 

[0075] Simultaneously, the microcontroller 95 is also taking readings of the motor current via the on chip analog to digital converter. These values are compared against an I.sup.2C bus supplied maximum current value, and if the measured current exceeds the desired maximum, the PWM output to the H-bridge is throttled back. This also runs at the same frequency as the PID loop. 

[0076] The controller 74 is designed to allow multiple controllers 74 to be stacked by utilizing a 40 conductor board to board connector 104, 105 (FIG. 13B) on both the top and bottom of the board. Because the system uses the multi-drop I.sup.2C bus, only two connections are needed between boards in addition to power. The majority of the conductors on these stacking connectors are used for power to overcome the single pin current limitations of small connectors like these. 

[0077] Motors are connected to their respective controllers 74 through a 2.times.5 100 mil spacing right angle header 103. This is a versatile connector which allows ribbon cable or discrete wiring to the motors. The motors used on this system were supplied with ribbon cable IDC connectors. 

[0078] Each board also features 5 LEDs, one of which is shown in FIG. 13A and the others shown in FIG. 13C, with the others connected to the microcontroller 95 as shown in FIG. 13A. There is a red LED (closest to the stacking connector) which is controlled by the motor current. Next is a yellow LED indicating the sign of the error from the PID loop, which indicates the direction the motor's shaft is being commanded to turn. The middle LED is currently unused and is available for future use. The green LED is used as a power/boot indicator and is under software control. Finally, another red LED (near the motor connector) is toggled each time an error is detected on the I.sup.2C bus to visually indicate bus reliability. 

[0079] Before the system can be used, the first mechanism 12 and the second mechanism 14 must be "homed"; that is, their relative positions must be determined. This is done by retracting both mechanisms until the linear actuators 46, 48 have reached the end of their range of travel, a condition detected by the system as an increase in actuator current. The control software 68 uses encoder information to record the positions of the first mechanism 12 and second mechanism 14, and homing is complete. 

[0080] The control software then puts the system in "stepped advancing" mode which is illustrated in FIG. 14. First, the first mechanism 12 is made rigid at 76. See also FIG. 15A. That is done by driving its tensioning motor 58 in the direction opposite the tension wire's 59 pull until the motor 58 stalls at its current limit. The second mechanism 14 is made limp at 78 by driving its tensioning motors 50, 51, 52 in the direction of the tension wires' pull by a fixed number of rotations, so that the wires become slack. The second mechanism 14 is advanced at 80 (See also FIG. 15B) so that it is positioned with its distal end one link's length beyond the first mechanism's 12 end. An encoder on the linear actuator 46 that is pushing the second mechanism 14 "counts" how far the second mechanism has moved. 

[0081] At this point, the software 68 is ready for user input. The software 68 monitors the position of the joystick 70 at 82, translating the two-axis data from the joystick into the three-axis coordinate system of the second mechanism 14. The positions of the shafts of the motors 50, 51, 52 controlling wires 54, 55, 56, respectively, are varied at 84 according to the translated joystick position. Once the user has steered the protruding link of the second mechanism 14 to the desired angle, the user presses a button on the joystick 70 to lock that angle in place as shown at 86. The three tensioning motors 50, 51, 52 are driven in the direction opposite the tension wires' 54, 55, 56 pull, until their current limits are reached and the motors stall at 88. This begins with the wire closest to the inside of the angle being formed, progressing after a small fixed delay to the next wire and finally the wire on the outermost part of the angle; tensioning the wires in this order preserves the user-selected angle more accurately than tensioning them simultaneously. 

[0082] Once each of the three motors 50, 51, 52 has reached its current limit, the second mechanism 14 is rigid and the first mechanism 12 can safely be made limp as shown by 90 by driving its tensioning motor 58 a fixed number of rotations in the direction of the tension wire's 59 pull. The first mechanism 12 is then advanced by one link's length, so that its distal end is even or coextensive with the second mechanism's 14 distal end as shown by 92 and FIG. 15C. An encoder on the linear actuator 48 that pushes the first mechanism 12 is used to count how far the first mechanism 12 advances. Once in this position, the distal links of both the first mechanism 12 and the second mechanism 14 are at the same angle. The first mechanism 12 is then made rigid to preserve this angle, and the second mechanism 14 is made limp as shown by 76 and 78. In this way the process continues, steering the distal link, locking its position in place, and advancing in single-link steps until the first mechanism 12 and second mechanism 14 have been advanced to the desired length and path shape. 

[0083] The description of motion in conjunction with FIG. 14 and FIGS. 15A-15C assumes that a camera, not shown, is positioned on the distal link of the second mechanism 14. Thus, the second mechanism 14 does the steering while the first mechanism 12 simply follows along. The process could of course be reversed with the camera being positioned on the first mechanism 12 such that the first mechanism 12 does the steering, while the second mechanism 14 does the following. In another embodiment, cameras could be provided on the distal ends of both the first mechanism 12 and the second mechanism 14 such that the two mechanisms "leap frog" one another. That is, rather than one of the mechanisms merely catching up with the other, after it is caught up, it can advance by one link because of its capability of being steered. The other mechanism then "catches up" and advances by one link's length because it too has the capability of steering. It is anticipated that with such a device, a desired position for the end of the HARP 10 may be obtained more quickly. 

[0084] Although it is anticipated that steering may be achieved through the use of cameras, other mechanisms may be used. For example, the distal links of each of the first mechanism 12 and second mechanism 14 may be comprised of material which is visible through the use of x-rays, NMRI, or other such devices such that the HARP 10 may be steered by tracking the advance of the HARP 10 with such a device. Alternatively, a small amount of radioactive material may be placed on the distal end of each of the first mechanism 12 and second mechanism 14 such that the progress of the HARP 10 can be tracked. Control of the path and configuration of the HARP 10 may be accomplished through the use of intelligent algorithms. The present invention is not to be limited by the type of mechanism used to provide information for steering and/or guidance of the HARP 10. 

[0085] The process of retracting the mechanisms takes place in the same way as advancing does, but in reverse order, and without steering input from the user as shown in FIG. 16. Once the user has selected "Retracting" mode using the joystick 70, the second mechanism 14 is retracted so that its distal end is even with the distal end of the first mechanism 12. The second mechanism 14 is made rigid, and the first mechanism 12 is made limp. Then the first mechanism 12 is retracted by one link's length, and the first mechanism 12 is made rigid. The second mechanism 14 is made limp, and again retracted until the distal end of the second mechanism is even with the distal end of the first mechanism 12. That cycle continues until the user presses a button to stop it, or until the first mechanism 12 and second mechanism 14 reach their home positions. 

[0086] Turning now to experimental results, an off-the-shelf fiber optic based camera and video camera, such as the Olympus PF14 insertion tube 1.4 mm was introduced through the open central portion of the links of an inner core 12 designed to have a 6 mm diameter opening. Another option would be to integrate the video camera into the walls of the links of the outer sleeve 14, which are currently 3 mm thick. With such a device, and as shown in FIGS. 18 and 19, we were able to navigate the pericardial space of a porcine. 

[0087] The normal pericardium is a double-layered, flask-shaped sac consisting of an outer fibrous envelope and in inner serous sac that is invaginated by the heart. The pericardial cavity or sac is a continuous virtual space that lies between the two opposite layers of serous pericardium. At the pericardial reflections and at the posterior wall between the great vessels, the pericardial space is apportioned into a contiguous network of recesses and sinuses; all pericardial reflections are located basally in relation to the great vessels. Thus, there are no obstacles during intrapericardial navigation along the anterior ventricular surface of the heart. There are three sinuses in the pericardial space: the superior sinus (also referred to as superior aortic recess), the transverse sinus contains several recesses between the major vessels (superior aortic, inferior aortic, right pulmonary and left pulmonary recess). The inferior aortic recess allows access to the epicardial aspect of the noncoronary and right coronary aortic cusps. The oblique sinus extends behind the atria, particularly the left atrium, in the region between the four pulmonary veins. There are five recesses of the pericardial cavity: superior aortic (SAR), inferior aortic (AR), postcaval (PCR), left pulmonary (LPVR) and right pulmonary (RPVR). 

[0088] As shown in FIGS. 18 and 19, we were able to explore the oblique sinus and visualize the posterior atrium, explore the transverse sinus with entry from the right and from the left with visualization of the left atrial appendage and explore all five recesses (SAR, IAR, PCR, LPVR and RPVR). Thus, the device and method of the present invention allow for various types of endoscopy or visualization of internal organs (or parts) or intracavity spaces from an on-board camera (or lens and light pipe) mounted on an articulated probe. It is the real time images provided by the on-board camera that allow teleoperation, i.e. remote controlled , 3D guidance in real time. 

[0089] While the present invention has been described in connection with preferred embodiments thereof, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that many modifications, variations and substitutions are possible. For example, as shown in FIG. 20, the first mechanism 12 and the second mechanism 14 are shown in a spaced relationship, i.e. not one within the other. In such an embodiment, one or both of the mechanisms may have members for maintaining the spaced relationship as the device 10 moves. Accordingly, the present invention is not intended to be limited by the disclosed embodiments but rather is limited only by the scope of the following claims.

Description


CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION 

[0001] This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. .sctn.119(e) to provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 61/958,484, filed on Jul. 29, 2013, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. 

FIELD OF THE USE 

[0002] The present disclosure relates to fabricating multi-dimensional structures. 

BACKGROUND 

[0003] Additive manufacturing (AM) of biological systems has the potential to revolutionize the engineering of soft structures, bioprosthetics, and scaffolds for tissue repair. While 3D printing of metals, plastics, and ceramics has radically changed many fields, including medical devices, applying these same techniques for the printing of complex and soft biological structures has been limited. The major challenges are (i) deposition of soft materials with elastic moduli of less than 100 kilopascal (kPa), (ii) supporting these soft structures as they are printed so they do not collapse, (iii) removing any support material that is used, and (iv) keeping cells alive during this whole process using aqueous environments that are pH, ionic, temperature, and sterility controlled within tight tolerances. Expensive bioprinters that attempt to address these challenges have been produced, but have yet to achieve results using soft hydrogels that are comparable to results achieved using commercial grade thermoplastic printers. 

[0004] Some hydrogels are impossible to deposit in layers due to their tendency to flow or deform under steady-state loading. However, hydrogels are desirable materials for advanced biofabrication techniques because their structure underlies the function of complex biological systems, such as human tissue. 3D tissue printing (i.e., AM of tissues) seeks to fabricate macroscopic living composites of biomolecules and cells with relevant anatomical structure, which gives rise to the higher-order functions of nutrient transport, molecular signaling, and other tissue-specific physiology. Replicating the complex structures of tissues with AM requires true freeform fabrication, as tissues possess interpenetrating networks of tubes, membranes, and protein fibers that are difficult to fabricate using free-standing fused-deposition or photopolymerization techniques. Conventional AM techniques may not possess the level of spatial control necessary for freeform fabrication and rapid prototyping of soft tissues. 

[0005] Recent advances in 3D tissue printing represent solutions to highly specific problems encountered in the AM of hydrogel materials, and are often limited to a specific application. For example, Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) has been used to print avascular replicas of cartilaginous tissues as well as fugitive vasculatures, which can be used to cast a vascularized tissue. Similar to the powders used in Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF), dynamic support materials have been developed to enable the fabrication of soft materials in complex spatial patterns without the need of printed supports. These semi-solid materials may be capable of supporting the fusion of cells and gels; however, the latter cases are limited and do not constitute true freeform fabrication. Indeed, the most successful methods for fabricating macroscopic biological structures in vitro rely on casting and not AM, as conventional AM techniques may not be sufficient to recreate true tissue complexity. 

[0006] Many gels are ideal materials for biofabrication, because their structures underlie the function of complex biological systems, such as human tissues. The geometries of tissues may be difficult to recreate without techniques like Additive Manufacturing/3D printing, but the methods for 3D printing gels are limited. Many gels start as fluids and cannot be 3D printed without supports to prevent them from drooping or oozing. Conventional 3D printing techniques may not possess the level of control necessary for geometrically unrestrained 3D printing of gels and tissues. Attempts to print gels with FDM have yielded cartilage-like tissues as well as gels with simple networks of vessels, yet the results have been limited. Indeed, it is still easier and more effective to cast a tissue than it is to 3D print it, as conventional 3D printing techniques may not be sufficiently capable. 

SUMMARY 

[0007] The present disclosure describes a method for 3D printing gels referred to as Embedded Fusion Modeling (EFM), or Freeform Reversible Embedding of Suspended Hydrogels (FRESH). EFM is similar to FDM, but instead of depositing a material on top of previous depositions or supports, EFM embeds material near other embedded deposits inside an omnipresent support bath and relies on the triggered assembly or reorganization of the material using targeted heating, photopolymerization, crosslinking, slow reaction kinetics, or application of binders. For example, the support bath may provide divalent cations for crosslinking the printed material. For 3D printing techniques such as FDM, support materials are usually as stiff as the printed material and placed underneath or neighboring the print layers to prevent deformations. In EFM, the support material is everywhere, and the deposit is printed inside the support. The support bath is a non-newtonian fluid that allows for deposition of new material while maintaining a buoyant, physical support for already embedded deposits. When two embedded deposits are close enough, they fuse. After printing, the deposit can be removed from the support as a fully assembled construct. 

[0008] In one aspect of the present disclosure, a method includes providing support material within which the structure is fabricated, depositing, into the support material, structure material to form the fabricated structure, and removing the support material to release the fabricated structure from the support material. The provided support material is stationary at an applied stress level below a threshold stress level and flows at an applied stress level at or above the threshold stress level during fabrication of the structure. The provided support material is configured to mechanically support at least a portion of the structure and to prevent deformation of the structure during the fabrication of the structure. The deposited structure material is suspended in the support material at a location where the structure material is deposited. The structure material comprises a fluid that transitions to a solid or semi-solid state after deposition of the structure material. 

[0009] Implementations of the disclosure may include one or more of the following features. The support material may include a gel material. The support material may include a hydrogel material. The support material may include micronized particulates. The support material may include a thermo-reversible material. The structure material may include a material having an elastic moduli of less than 1 megapascal. The structure material may include at least one of a gel material that is different from the support material, a metal material, a ceramic material, or a polymer material. The structure material may include at least one of an alginate material, a collagen material, a fibrin material, a hyaluronic acid material, a protein material, a polysaccharide hydrogel material, synthetic gel material, an elastomer polymer material, a rigid polymer material, or a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer. The structure material may be deposited using a syringe-based extruder that is inserted into the support material and extrudes the structure material into the support material. The method may include treating the structure material to cause the structure material to transition from the fluid to the solid or semi-solid state after the deposition of the structure material. The support material may include a crosslinking agent for treating the structure material to cause the structure material to transition from the fluid to the solid or semi-solid state after the deposition of the structure material. The crosslinking agent may include at least one of calcium chloride or thrombin. The support material may include a material having a different pH from the structure material for treating the structure material to cause the structure material to transition from the fluid to the solid or semi-solid state after the deposition of the structure material. Treating the structure material may include heating the structure material, cooling the structure material, or radiating the structure material with ultraviolet light. Removing the support material may include heating the support material, cooling the support material, or removing cations to disrupt crosslinking of the support material. The fabricated structure may be a biological tissue or a tissue engineering scaffold. Depositing, into the support material, the structure material to form the fabricated structure can include depositing the structure material layer by layer in an XY plane, depositing the structure material layer by layer in an XZ plane, or depositing the structure material in a non-planar configuration. 

[0010] In another aspect of the present disclosure, a method includes performing a printing operation at approximately twenty degrees Celsius. The printing operation may include providing a gelatin slurry support bath within which the tissue scaffold is fabricated, extruding, from a nozzle, a hydrogel into the gelatin slurry support bath to form the tissue scaffold, and placing the gelatin slurry support bath with the extruded hydrogel into an incubator that is heated to approximately thirty-seven degrees Celsius to melt the gelatin slurry support bath and to release the tissue scaffold. The hydrogel has an elastic moduli of less than 1,000 kilopascal. The gelatin support bath flows in a presence of an applied force and transforms into a non-flowing fluid in an absence of the applied force. The gelatin slurry support bath includes calcium chloride to provide divalent cations to crosslink the hydrogel as the hydrogel is extruded out of the nozzle. The gelatin slurry support bath is configured to mechanically support the hydrogel and to prevent deformation of the hydrogel during printing of the tissue scaffold. 

[0011] Implementations of the disclosure may include one or more of the following features. The hydrogel may include at least one of alginate, collagen type I, fibrin, or hyaluronic acid. The hydrogel may include a cell laden hydrogel. 

[0012] Particular implementations of the subject matter described in this disclosure may be implemented to realize one or more of the following potential advantages. The 3D printing techniques described in this disclosure are applicable to gelling polymers and enable true freeform printing of complex geometries. The techniques can be used to produce anatomically correct, perfusable scaffolds of coronary arteries. The techniques are cross-platform and can easily be adopted for use on many open-source and proprietary 3D printers. 

[0013] Details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages will be apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 

[0034] Although the techniques described in the present disclosure are applicable to a wide range of manufacturing processing methods, various implementations will be described below in the context of additive manufacturing. While specific implementations are described, other implementations may exist that include operations and components different than those illustrated and described below. 

[0035] The present disclosure describes a method of embedding fused materials (EFM) within a support bath, where the embedded material is initially a fluid or flowable material that transitions to a solid or semi-solid state after deposition. The method can be used in the process of additive manufacturing (AM), also commonly referred to as freeform fabrication or 3D printing, of soft materials to fabricate 2D or 3D structures and objects based on a 3D digital design, which may be difficult using traditional techniques or current additive manufacturing approaches. While specific examples of soft materials and their characteristics are provided below, EFM is not limited to printing materials with a specific material hardness and other materials with different characteristics may be printed. 

[0036] The soft materials can include fluids that have substantially low elastic modulus when being printed. Traditionally, printing a fluid in air may be difficult because the fluid may flow away from the deposition site. 

[0037] The soft materials can include solid materials that have an elastic modulus in the range of approximately 10 GPa to 0.1 kPa. These solid materials may sag or deform if printed in air. For example, stiff materials such as cements, resins, and concretes can be printed using EFM. Composites involving metal-ceramic or metal-carbon alloys can also be printed using EFM. 

[0038] The soft materials can include materials that have an elastic modulus that is initially low and increases over time due to crosslinking or assembly of the material. The final elastic modulus of these materials may be in the GPa range after crosslinking or assembly, but may be difficult to print using other techniques because the elastic modulus was much lower during the print process. An example of such materials include an epoxy resin that is mixed but has not yet cured, so it is a liquid during printing but then cures overtime into a rigid plastic. Another example is a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer (e.g., Sylgard 184, Dow Corning) that can be mixed as a prepolymer, printed as a liquid, and then cured for 48 hours at room temperature while still immobilized in the gelatin slurry support material before being released at 37 degrees Celsius. 

[0039] The soft materials are printed inside a temporary support material that can be removed later by, e.g., heating or cooling the support material to dissolve or melt the support material, or removing cations to disrupt crosslinking of the support material. Additional techniques for removing the support material include vibration, irradiation with ultraviolet, infrared, or visible light, or application of a constant or oscillating electric or magnetic field. 

[0040] The support material may be any material that acts as a viscoplastic material with Bingham plastic-like rheological behavior. The support material may demonstrate a significant shear thinning behavior such that the support material acts like a solid material during deposition of the structure materials and then acts like a fluid when the nozzle is moved through the support material such that the nozzle movement does not disturb the deposited structure material. The support material may exhibit viscoplastic behavior where it acts as a solid below a threshold shear stress and flows like a liquid above the threshold shear stress. The characteristic that makes a support material suitable for EFM is a drop in viscosity under dynamic loading. In EFM, the dynamic loading is caused by the force of an extruder moving through the support material, affecting the support material in a number of ways. The extruder could change the support material by imposing a mechanical load via shear, pressure, or vibration. The extruder could irradiate or heat the support material to thin it. Alternatively, a suitable material could lose viscosity under vibration, heating, or irradiation that occurs locally to the extruder. 

[0041] For example, the support material can include a Bingham plastic, or Bingham plastic-like, material that is a solid material when not perturbed, but shear thins and provides minimal resistance when a nozzle moves through it. The support material can include other materials with viscoplastic behavior, such as Herschel-Bulkley fluid. Bingham plastics and Herschel-Bulkley fluids are viscoplastic materials included in the "shear-thinning" or "yield-stress fluid" category. Below a specific shear stress, these materials appear as a solid material. Above a threshold shear force, these materials behave as a fluid. A Bingham plastic may not necessarily "shear thin," but rather may act much like a Newtonian fluid once it begins to flow. In contrast, the Herschel-Buckley fluid undergoes shear thinning once it begins to flow. 

[0042] Thus, a 3D bioprinter can lower a syringe-based extruder into the support material and move around and deposit material in arbitrary 3D geometries. The extruded material stays in place once the tip of the extruder moves away, thus forming the 3D printed object. Once the complete 3D object is printed and the structural material has sufficiently assembled, the support material is removed. 

[0043] A structure can be printed in any direction in 3D space. In addition to the typical 3D printing that is done layer by layer in the XY plane, a structure can also be printed layer by layer in a non-XY plane, such as the XZ plane, or a plane at any angle. A structure can also be printed in a non-planar fashion in a curved path, such as a helix. Structures with material mechanical properties that are different in the plane of printing versus orthogonal to the plane of printing can thus be printed using EFM. In particular, the fabricated structured can have three-dimensions, and the fabricated structure can have printed anisotropic mechanical properties in a direction that lie in XY plane. For example, EFM can be used to print in the direction of nerve fibers in 3D, or in the direction of muscle fibers in 3D. 

[0044] Some AM techniques rely on the triggered assembly or reorganization of a material using targeted heating, photopolymerization, or jetted glues to bind a powder substrate. EFM is more similar to Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), but in FDM, material is deposited on top of a previously deposited layer, which provides the necessary mechanical support to build multiple layers since this process occurs in an environment with no buoyant or conformal supports and requires the co-printing of supporting structures. In contrast, EFM deposits material near previously deposited material, but not necessarily on top of it. Specifically, the support bath material provides mechanical support with the deposited, embedded materials able to fuse in any direction as long as proximity is sufficient. To accomplish this, fusible material is deposited into the support bath material, which behaves as a buoyant, non-Newtonian support. Support materials are usually as stiff as the intended deposit and placed underneath or neighboring the deposit to prevent deformation of the deposit. In EFM, the support material is everywhere, and the deposit is embedded inside the support material during printing. After printing, the object can be removed from the support as an intact object. 

[0045] EFM can print any fluid that transitions to a solid or semi-solid state after deposition. Examples of materials which can be manufactured using EFM are ceramics, metals, polymers, sol-gel mixtures, composites, and gels. Concretes, cements, clays, slurries and colloids of metals and metallic or semi-metallic oxides, epoxies, resins, silicones, and thermoplastics can all be assembled using EFM. Additionally, EFM is also capable of 3D printing gels made from proteins, polysaccharides, or other polymers and stable hydrocolloids. Additionally, foods such as Nutella, mayonnaise, or chocolate, and adhesives such as cyanoacrylates can also be assembled using EFM. EFM can also be used to print biologically derived protein and/or polysaccharide hydrogels such as chitosan or Matrigel, synthetic hydrogels such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) based hydrogels, and other synthetic gel, elastomer and rigid polymers such as polydimethylsiloxane, polyurethanes, thermosets, coacervate solids, and foams. 

[0046] Support materials used in EFM can include any slurry or fluid exhibiting properties which allow it to support the embedding of a fusible material. Some examples of support materials are mayonnaise, albumin-foams, gelatin slurries, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAM) slurries, polyacrylate slurries, alginate slurries, and structured fluids displaying non-newtonian, Bingham Plastic behaviors, or other viscoplastic materials such as Herschel-Bulkley fluid. Conditions inside the support materials could be used to trigger the transition of the embedded material from fluid to solid or semi-solid state. 

[0047] For example, a ceramic slurry consisting of an aggregate material surrounded by a suspension of hydrating minerals can be deposited into a pseudofluid slurry. This enables the printing of cement-like or colloidal ceramics into complex shapes without the need for a powder & binder-based printing process. Additionally, a Bingham plastic oil-in-water emulsion could be used as a support material. 

[0048] In some implementations, a 3D printing technique referred to as Freeform Reversible Embedding of Suspended Hydrogels (FRESH) to enable the 3D printing of soft, biological hydrogel structures that may be too soft to fabricate using other 3D printing techniques. The structures may be any 3D design including anatomical structures in humans or the target organism for the object, such as the tissue engineering of an organ. FRESH enables true freeform printing of complex geometries and enables the geometrically uninhibited fabrication of biopolymers and cell suspensions by embedding them in thermo-reversible support material. FRESH printing may be a significant improvement over alternative 3D bioprinting approaches in terms of capability, cost, safety, speed, and ease of use. FRESH is cross-platform, and can therefore be easily adopted for use on an open-source or proprietary FDM 3D Printer. 

[0049] FRESH uses a support bath material that enables biological hydrogels to be directly printed in 3D complexity using a range of soft biomaterials including alginate, collagen, hyaluronic acid, and fibrin. The thermo-reversible support bath may be composed of microparticles that act as a Bingham plastic or Herschel-Buckley fluid during the print process. As a nozzle moves through the bath, it shear thins and offers little mechanical resistance, yet the hydrogel being extruded out of the nozzle and deposited within the bath is held in place. The nozzle of the extruder moves through the support material fast enough such that the nozzle generates a shear stress above a threshold shear force and therefore sees the support material as a fluid. In contrast, the structure material deposited by the extruder out of the nozzle has a shear stress below the threshold shear force and therefore sees the support material as a solid material, and thus stays where it is deposited. Thus, soft materials that would collapse if printed in air or other bath materials are easily maintained in the intended 3D geometry. The process is performed in a sterile aqueous, buffered environment compatible with cells, which means cells can be extruded out of the printer nozzle with the hydrogel and maintain viability. Once the entire 3D structure is FRESH printed, the thermo-reversible property of the support bath material can be used to melt out the support bath at a cell-friendly 37.degree. C., completely removing the support in a non-destructive manner. 

[0050] A range of materials using FRESH have been 3D printed, including alginate, collagen, fibrin, matrigel, photo-crosslinkable hyaluronic acid, cell suspension in collagen, and PDMS, which is a non-hydrogel. A wide range of 3D objects have been printed including geometric solids, vascular networks, whole organs such as the embryonic heart, and intricate scaffolds. FRESH can be used to tissue engineer a range of tissue types, including, for example, cardiac muscle tissue for the repair of congenital heart defects and myocardial infarction, vascular networks for the repair/regeneration of skeletal muscle tissue, and high-fidelity tissue engineering of skeletal muscle for craniofacial repair. The possibilities can extend beyond muscular tissues, potentially allowing for any known tissue type, including precursor embryonic tissues. The engineered tissues created using FRESH can be used in vitro models of tissue/organ function and/or as disease model systems. 

[0051] FRESH may be used to 3D print biological tissues and tissue engineering scaffolds for application in regenerative medicine. A thermoreversible, Bingham plastic slurry supports the embedding, assembly, and release of a gelling polymer. In turn, conditions inside the slurry could be used to trigger the polymerization of the printed material. For the slurry, gelatin may be used in a calcium-rich solution, and for the gelling polymer, alginate may be used. However, FRESH is not limited to these materials. FRESH can be expanded to include any Bingham plastic or Herschel-Buckley fluid support material. Additionally, any gelling biomaterial or organogel can be used as an ink. Depending on the ink, any reversible gel can be used as a support, for example, alginate gels, collagen gels, PNIPAAM, or an organogel. 

[0052] Using FRESH, perfusable scaffolds of coronary vasculatures can be fabricated using public-access MRI data, for example, open-source softwares such as Skeinforge and ReplicatorG, and an open-source MakerBot 3D printer. For example, FRESH can be used to produce anatomically correct, perfusable scaffolds of coronary arteries. Scaffolds with this range of mechanical properties are required for the tissue engineering of soft tissues. In one example, alginate or proteinaceous scaffolds composed of various geometries can be 3D printed in a support material. The support material may be a gelatin slurry in the form of micronized particulates. The support material is placed in a support bath supplemented with calcium chloride (CaCl.sub.2). Alginate scaffolds are then 3D printed within the support bath, where the calcium ions crosslink the alginate and the gelatin mechanically supports the alginate. Once the alginate scaffolds are printed, the gelatin is melted by heating the gelatin to its melting temperature (37.degree. C.) and then removed by washing it out. 

[0053] While the above example demonstrates FRESH using alginate crosslinked by calcium chloride in the support bath, alginate is just one example of the embedded material. For example, the alginate can be modified with covalently grafted polypeptides to add additional biofunctionality such as adhesion sites for integrins or degradation sites that can be cleaved by matrix metalloproteinases. The alginate can also be blended with other polymers such as collagen or fibrin. Instead of alginate, fibrin can be printed by putting fibrinogen in the extruder and then use the calcium chloride in the bath and/or thrombin in the support bath to crosslink the fibrinogen into fibrin. Another example is printing collagen type I. The collagen I may be in a slightly acidic solution to prevent polymerization. The collagen type I is placed in the syringe and printed in a gelatin bath. The gelatin bath has a neutral pH, which triggers gelation of the collagen I. After printing, the bath is heated to 37.degree. C., which simultaneously provides additional crosslinking of the collagen and melts the gelatin. As an alternative to heating, photochemistry may be used to crosslink the embedded material. For example, photocrosslinkable hyaluronic acid can be printed in the support bath, and UV light applied during the print process and/or afterwards is used to crosslink the hyaluronic acid into a hydrogel. There are multiple comparable examples of embedded soft materials and using various factors (e.g., heat, enzymes, light) to trigger transition of the printed material from a fluid into a gel or stiffer materials. Factors that trigger transition of the printed material can include, e.g., chemical exposure, vibration, radiation using ultraviolet, infrared, or visible light, and application of a magnetic or electric field. 

[0054] While the above example describes the support bath as a gelatin particulate slurry that acts as a Bingham plastic-like material, there are a wide range of other materials that can be used to create the support bath. For example, instead of gelatin, ultra-low melting point Agarose can be used in a similar manner, where particulates are formed and used to make a slurry. The Agarose has a similar thermo-reversible characteristic to gelatin and thus can be melted at physiologic temperatures. Other forms of Agarose with higher melting temperatures could be used for print materials with different thermal properties. 

[0055] FRESH printing can be implemented using a 3D printer based on open-source designs, or commercially available derivatives. For example, a fab@home model 2 3D printer comes with a syringe-based tool that can extrude soft materials. The fab@home is a widely used syringe-based printer for soft materials with examples of the printer being used to create alginate heart valves, silicone chemical reaction vessels, and even a bionic ear. 

[0056] As another example, a RepRap derivative printer, which has a large array of open-source tools, is used. The stock MakerBot uses fused filament fabrication (FFF) where a thermoplastic filament (typically ABS or PLA) is fed into a heated chamber, melted, and then extruded before it cools and solidifies. This process may not work for hydrogels because they are too soft (flexible) to be used in filament extrusion. A syringe extruder is available on the MakerBot, termed the Frostruder, and a variant is used to 3D print sugar scaffolds that could be used to template vascular networks. However, the large volume of the syringe and pneumatic control may not provide the desired level of control. A syringe-pump based extruder may be designed on SolidWorks where the stepper motor from the original extruder is used via a direct gear drive to push the plunger of a syringe with Luer lock tip. The syringe-pump extruder was 3D printed of PLA or ABS plastic using the MakerBot's stock FFF extruder. The FFF extruder was then replaced with the syringe-pump extruder, converting the MakerBot into a bioprinter. 

[0057] FIG. 1 shows a 3D CAD rendering of the syringe-pump extruder 100 showing the location where the syringe is mounted (syringe holder 102), where the support carriage 104 is that mounts to the MakerBot X-axis rails and the location where the stepper motor is housed (stepper motor housing 106). Note that the stock extruder is first used to print the syringe-pump extruder 100 in PLA or ABS plastic, and then replaced. The overall design of the syringe-pump extruder 100 has similar mass and shape to the original stock extruder and once mounted integrates seamlessly with the MakerBot hardware and software. The only calibration necessary is to determine the number of motor steps that extrudes a given amount of fluid, which is determined experimentally for the alginate and collagen hydrogels printed. Typically, it places a 250 .mu.m diameter stainless steel nozzle on the end of the syringe, but a range of sizes can be selected to control the diameter of extruded material. 

[0058] FIG. 2 shows FRESH printing using a gelatin slurry as the thermo-reversible Bingham plastic support bath 202 and alginate 204 as the soft hydrogel being printed. The size of gelatin particles may interfere with alginate print topology, so gelatin slurries may be blended in a common blender, resulting in a narrower distribution of smaller particles. For example, slurries blended for 60 seconds were shown to have a dominant elastic behavior that is characteristic of a Bingham Plastic. CaCl.sub.2 in the support bath 202 provides divalent cations to crosslink the alginate 204 as it is extruded out of the nozzle 206. The printing process occurs at room temperature (e.g., approximately 20.degree. C.). Layers of deposited alginate gel, each representing a 2-dimensional slice of a 3D object, were built up by successive depositions to create a 3D scaffold. Once the printing is complete, the temperature is increased to 37.degree. C. in order to melt the gelatin of the support bath 202 and release the embedded alginate structure 208. 

[0059] Gelatin is selected as the material for the support bath 202 for the bioprinting of soft biological materials because it has many advantages including (i) inexpensive, (ii) biocompatible, (iii) thermo-reversible at physiologic temperatures, and (iv) readily available in a particulate form. Gelatin is a widely used biopolymer derived from collagen type I and normally is dissolved in warm water and then cooled down to form a crosslinked hydrogel. In this form, gelatin is not a Bingham plastic and will not work as the support bath 202. However, the gelatin powder as purchased can be added to room temperature (approximately 20.degree. C.) water, and then the excess water can be drained off to form a gelatin particulate slurry. Alternatively, the gelatin slurry can be made by blending a block of gelatin gel in a jar with additional fluid. The result is a gelatin slurry that has gelatin particles with lower stiffness and greater transparency than the block of gelatin gel. However, any manner in which small gelatin gels can be fabricated can be used to make a gelatin slurry. For example, emulsion of warm gelatin solution in oil followed by cooling results in a gelatin microsphere suspension that can also be used as a support material. 

[0060] The gelatin slurry behaves as a Bingham plastic, where the hydrated particulates act as a viscous fluid under the high stress of the extruder nozzle 206 moving through the bath 202 but a solid under low stress. 3D printing is done at room temperature to keep the gelatin as a solid, and alginate 204 is extruded into the slurry as the printed material. The support bath 202 is supplemented with CaCl.sub.2 to provide divalent cations to crosslink the alginate 204 as it is extruded out of the nozzle 206. Once the 3D printing is complete, the bath 202 is heated to 37.degree. C. in order to melt the gelatin and release the embedded alginate structure 208. 

[0061] FRESH can be used to fabricate biological materials and structures. The gelatin slurry has an aqueous environment with neutral pH and physiological levels of CaCl.sub.2. The temperature range is cell friendly, with most cells able to survive at room temperature for the printing process and at 37.degree. C. for the thermal release. Initial studies printing C2C12 cells inside the alginate has shown greater than 97% cell survival using Live/Dead cell staining. 

[0062] This system can print a large range of 3D objects including basic geometric solids, various 2D and 3D meshes, and anatomical structures based on medical imaging data. For example, FIGS. 3A and 3B show FRESH printing of the logo 306 using a 3D printer including an XY syringe-based extruder 300 that deposits hydrogels from a nozzle 302 into a thermo-reversible support bath 304. The FRESH printing process is based on using a thermo-reversible support bath 304 that can be removed after the printing process is completed. The support bath 304 needs to allow the nozzle 302 of the extruder 300 to move through the bath 304 with minimal resistance, but provide support to the extruded hydrogel. The support bath 304 may be achieved using a thermo-reversible Bingham plastic material, which is solid at low stresses and a viscous fluid at high stresses. The support bath 304 enables the embedding of a hydrogel during printing followed by non-destructive release when completed. The thermo-reversible support bath 304 may be composed of microparticles that act as a Bingham plastic during the print process. 

[0063] As the nozzle 302 moves through the bath 304 it shear thins and offers little mechanical resistance, yet the hydrogel being extruded out of the nozzle 302 and deposited within the bath 304 is held in place. Thus, soft materials that would collapse if printed in air, or other bath materials, are easily maintained in the intended 3D geometry. Once the entire 3D structure is FRESH printed, the thermo-reversible property can be used to melt out the support bath 304 at a cell-friendly 37.degree. C., completely removing the support bath 304 in a non-destructive manner. The printing is done in a sterile aqueous, buffered environment compatible with cells, which means cells can be extruded out of the printer nozzle with the hydrogel and maintain viability. 

[0064] In FIGS. 3A and 3B, the logo 306 was printed in alginate in the gelatin slurry support bath 304. The alginate was mixed with food coloring to aid visualization during the printing process and various time points (a)-(d) show the layer-by-layer fabrication. The cloudiness of the bath is due to the particulate gelatin. As the nozzle of the extruder moves through the bath it disrupts the gelatin particles above the printing plane, but not below it. The logo 306 is printed in high fidelity at a 5 mm height, and even the overhang of the letter "C" is well formed and perfectly maintained using the support bath 304, which would be difficult to print with soft materials using other methods. Once the print is completed, the printing platform of the 3D printer is heated above 37.degree. C. in time points (e) and (f) to melt the gelatin so the printed logo 306 can be removed from the bath 304. Note the surface of the bath 304 in the last time point (f) where the change from particles to liquid is visible. 

[0065] Similarly, 3D models of the right coronary arterial tree from a human heart can be scaled-down and printed using FRESH with high fidelity. FIG. 4A shows a 3D CAD model 400 of the coronary artery vasculature from a human heart. Coronary artery 3D models based on whole-body MRI imaging can be downloaded from a database that has 3D data for major arteries and veins in the body. The right coronary arterial tree was downloaded and the hollow model 400 was created in MeshLab by resampling the solid model to create a smaller child model with inverted normals to serve as negative space. When the models are flattened as layers into the same mesh file, a hollow model 400 with internal and external surfaces results. 

[0066] FIG. 4B shows a scaled-down FRESH printed vasculature 404 embedded within a support bath 406 with a US penny 408 for size reference. Using fluorescently-labeled alginate, the arterial tree was 3D printed with an internal luminal diameter of approximately 1 mm. The printed vasculature 404 can be released intact from the thermo-reversible support bath 406 and imaged using a laser scanning confocal microscope to visualize the hollow lumen that is generated. FIG. 4C shows the FRESH printed vasculature 404 after thermal release from the support bath 406 and imaged using a confocal microscope showing the hollow lumen with a diameter of approximately 1 mm. These scaffolds have been printed with 100% alginate a 50:50 mixture of alginate and collagen, pure collagen 1 solution, and pure fibrinogen solution. 

[0067] Tubular and beam-like structures with simple mechanical behaviors can be compounded to print constructs with higher order functions. For example, solids with negative Poisson's ratios or hollow geometries can be printed. FIG. 5 shows a printed alginate mesh of collapsed hexagonal units in an unstrained form 500 and a strained form 502 under axial strain displaying transverse expansion, which indicates a negative Poisson's Ratio. FIG. 6 shows a parametric tubular structure 602 with a 2 mm inner diameter and bifurcation that was designed in CAD and printed, revealing a gel manifold capable of dividing fluid flow. FIG. 7 shows a cross-section view 702, a side view 704, and a close-up cross-section view 706 of a two-material cylinder with inner material 710 and outer material 712. The cross-section view 702 and the side view 704 are shown at a scale of 2 mm. The close-up cross-section view 706 is shown at a scale of 500 .mu.m. 

[0068] Another example of a structure that can be printed using FRESH is a filament. FIG. 8 shows a fluorescence image 800 of an alginate filament 802 embedded among gelatin particles 804 at a scale of 1 mm. FIG. 9 shows a rectilinear pattern 900 of filaments 906 and fluorescence images 902 and 904 of the filaments 906 at a scale of 500 .mu.m. FIG. 10 shows an octagonal pattern 1000 of filaments 1006 and fluorescence images 1002 and 1004 of the filaments 1006 at a scale of 500 .mu.m. 

[0069] Yet another example of a structure that can be printed using FRESH is a helix. FIG. 11 shows a helix 1010 being printed at various time points (a)-(c). FIG. 11 shows that FRESH can be used to print a 3D structure in any direction in 3D space, including in a non-planar fashion. 

[0070] While alginate is a suitable print material for some structures, other materials may be used to print biological materials and structures. In general, alginate is not cell adhesive, and therefore may not be suitable for use in printing tissue engineering scaffold. One option is to modify the alginate with cell adhesive polypeptides of proteins. For example, alginate can be modified by the covalent linking of the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) amino acid sequence to bind cells, or a wide range of other bioactive molecule. This may expand the utility of the alginate directly as a biomaterial and the optimal concentration of RGD-modified alginate will need to be added in order to make the printed alginate cell adhesive. The alginate can be used to facilitate gelation of other hydrogel biomaterials. Specifically, blends of alginate may be developed with both collagen type I and fibrinogen in order to develop cell adhesive scaffolds that can be remodeled by cells. 

[0071] FRESH can be used to 3D print PDMS. The PDMS is printed as a liquid that cures over 48 hours. FIG. 12 shows 3D printed PDMS in the form of interconnected chain links 1012. 

[0072] FRESH demonstrates the application of fused deposition principles to the 3D printing of a gelling polymer. It utilizes widely-available open-source software and hardware to create a functional gel-prototyping system with true freeform fabrication capabilities. Gelatin slurry is a biocompatible, inexpensive, and readily available Bingham Plastic which liquefies just below human body temperature. Initial prints using the present invention can be done with food-grade gelatin powder retrieved from various grocery stores. Alginate is a biocompatible, inexpensive, readily available, and reversible material for cell-encapsulation. Alginate can also support the gelation of major biopolymers such as collagen and fibrin. Thus, FRESH may enable true freeform fabrication of any gelling biopolymer. Any biopolymer like collagen can be mixed and FRESH-printed with alginate; the alginate can be removed to reveal a collagen print. FRESH can be implemented on any RepRap 3D printer. Furthermore, these printers can be modified to print complex gel structures and perfusable vascular models with biocompatible materials. 

[0073] FRESH is designed to enable rapid tissue prototyping and foster widespread iterative improvements to engineered tissue designs. FRESH is capable of 3D printing any hydrophilic gel as long as it can be confined by a mechanism such as diffusion limiting. The gelatin support slurry can be combined with cell growth medium and gelling biopolymers such as collagen and fibrin, and Matrigel can be printed with cells to effectively 3D print living tissues. In one example, live-dead assays demonstrate high cell viability during FRESH printing with Collagen I and C2C12 cells. FIG. 13 shows an image 1100 and a 3D representation 1102 of C2C12 cells printed in Collagen I gel. Image 1100 shows the concentration of cells 2 hours after printing. The 3D representation 1102 shows the concentration of cells in the collagen construct 24 hours after printing. As seen in the 3D representation 1102, the cells attach and spread throughout the printed collagen construct. FIG. 14 shows 3D representations 1200, 1202, 1204 of C2C12 myoblasts in a collagen construct. The 3D representations 1200 and 1202 show the concentration of cells after 24 hours of incubation, and the 3D representation 1204 shows the concentration of cells after 7 days of incubation. The 3D representations 1202 and 1204 are shown at a scale of 50 .mu.m. FIG. 15 shows 3D representations 1300, 1302, 1304 of MC3T3 fibroblasts in a collagen construct. The 3D representations 1300 and 1302 show the concentration of cells after 24 hours of incubation, and the 3D representation 1304 shows the concentration of cells after 7 days of incubation. The 3D representations 1302 and 1304 are shown at a scale of 50 .mu.m. The 3D representations of the cells in the collagen constructs show that cells spread quickly and reach high density as the tissue compacts and the cells multiply. Because a tissue printed using FRESH can be released by placement in an incubator running at 37.degree. C., FRESH essentially represents a two-step solution for rapidly prototyping tissues. Open-source frameworks for cell incubation are actively being developed, and a one-step print-and-incubate Rapid Tissue Prototyping machine is plausible. 

[0074] FIG. 16 is a flowchart of a process 1400 for fabricating a multidimensional structure. Briefly, the process 1400 includes providing support material within which the structure is fabricated (1402); depositing, into the support material, structure material to form the fabricated structure (1404); treating the structure material to cause the structure material to transition from the fluid to the solid or semi-solid state after the deposition of the structure material (1406); and removing the support material to release the fabricated structure from the support material (1408). The process 1400 will now be described in the context of FRESH printing alginate scaffolds in a gelatin slurry bath. However, other suitable materials may be used instead of alginate and gelatin. 

[0075] A support material, such as a gelatin slurry bath, is provided (1402). To create the gelatin slurry bath, 30 grams of gelatin may be hydrated in excess 7 mM CaCl.sub.2 at 4.degree. C. The slurry may be blended with a blender for 60 seconds in a 500 mL mason jar and centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 3 minutes. Slurry supernatant may be aspirated and replaced with 7 mM CaCl.sub.2 at 20.degree. C. The slurry may be resuspended by vortexing. This washing procedure may be repeated two additional times, except the gelatin slurry is not replenished with 7 mM CaCl.sub.2 the final time. Washed slurry may be loaded into 60 mm diameter glass petri dishes to be used for FRESH prints. 

[0076] The structure material may be a solution of fluorescent alginate. A solution of 2.0%-w/v Sodium Alginate, 0.02%-w/v 6-Aminofluorescein, 0.022%-w/v EDC, and 0.025% w/v Sulfo-NHS may be prepared and stirred for 48 hours at 20.degree. C. Unreacted 6-Aminofluorescein may be removed by five consecutive 12 hr dialysis shifts against 2%-w/v Sodium Alginate at 4.degree. C. in dialysis cassettes. 

[0077] Before printing, a standard 3 mL syringe with a 0.25 mm-ID stainless steel nozzle may be filled with a solution of 0.08%-w/v fluorescein-labeled alginic acid and 1.92% w/v Sodium Alginate and loaded onto a custom-modified Replicator 3D Printer. Digital models of the alginate scaffolds may be created using, for example, SolidWorks and MeshLab softwares. Alginate scaffolds were printed in the gelatin slurry bath at 20.degree. C. (1404), heated to 37.degree. C. (1406), and washed free from molten gelatin slurry with 0.13 M CaCl.sub.2 (1408). 

[0078] FRESH makes it possible to 3D print protein scaffolds within a thermally-reversible support bath that can be selectively remove once the entire scaffold is complete. Thus, FRESH can be used to engineer a variety of tissues. 

[0079] For example, FRESH can be used to engineer complex 3D heart tissue with a level of structure and functional performance that is difficult to create using alternative approaches. To 3D print anatomically-optimized engineered cardiac tissues, a 3D computer model of the neonatal human ventricle may be built based on 3D MRI scans, which enables the use of computational modeling to optimize the tissue design to maximize performance as well as optimize the design for 3D printing. An enhanced version of the FRESH 3D printing process is used that uses alginate-collagen blends for fabricating tissue engineering scaffolds. Printing parameters to maximize cell survival and integration into the construct are optimized, making sure to match degradation rates with the formation of new muscle tissue. A 3D human heart muscle may then be engineered using human stem cell derived cardiomyocytes. FIG. 17 shows a FRESH print of an embryonic chicken heart 1500 next to a penny 1502 and a fluorescence image 1504 of a layer of the FRESH printed embryonic chicken heart 1500 at a scale of 1 cm. The fluorescence image 1504 shows the internal structures of the FRESH printed embryonic chicken heart 1500. 

[0080] As another example, FRESH can be used for 3D printing of complex vasculature for repair of traumatic muscle injury. FRESH 3D bioprinting can be used in order to engineer patient-specific vascular networks for rapid regeneration of large-volume muscle defects. This vascular network may be composed of ECM proteins and serves as the scaffold to guide muscle regeneration as well as provide nutrient mass transport. FRESH can engineer patent, complex, 3D vascular networks that scale from main arteries and veins down to arterioles and venuoles, with 1 mm internal diameter. This level of structural and functional performance may be difficult to create using alternative approaches. FRESH has the capability to 3D print a high-density vascular network, which can be used to engineer large-volume skeletal muscle constructs. 

[0081] FRESH can be used to engineer high-fidelity muscle tissue engineering for craniofacial repair. Fine skeletal muscles appropriate for craniofacial reconstruction following traumatic injury to the head can be engineered. For example, skeletal muscle cells can be integrated into nanostructured fibers composed of the extracellular matrix protein, such as collagen. This will result in a living cell thread composed entirely of cells and biopolymers, eliminating any synthetic polymers from the system. Skeletal myoblasts can be seeded onto collagen fibers 3D printed with FRESH, or mixed with the collagen and FRESH printed directly as cell-laden fiber to create living muscle fiber threads of highly aligned muscle cells. Once myoblasts cell fibers are created, the cells will align and fuse into myotubes. Once the living muscle fiber threads are generated with FRESH, they can be used to weave muscle tissue constructs that recapitulate the overall shape and cellular architecture of craniofacial muscles. Using custom bioreactors, support posts can be integrated into 35-mm cell culture Petri dishes around which the cell threads can be weaved. Alternatively, the posts and cell threads can be printed in the same construct. The posts can be printed from PDMS, and the tissue can be printed from collagen and cell suspensions. This would be an example of printing hybrid synthetic and living prints with complex purposes. By proper placement of these post and weaving patterns, a variety of muscle structures can be regenerated. 

[0082] FIG. 18 illustrates weaving used to regenerate various muscle structures using the living muscle fiber threads. FRESH provides the capability to regenerate both parallel muscle tissue types 1602 and convergent muscle tissue types 1604. Parallel muscles 1602 have a spindle shape and circular cross-section with all muscle cells aligned in the same, uniaxial direction. To recreate this structure, the living muscle fiber thread 1607 is wrapped back-and-forth between to support posts 1606 and 1608. Convergent muscles 1604 have more of a fan shape corresponding cross-section that is thin and wide. To recreate this structure, the living muscle fiber thread 1610 is wrapped around one post 1612 on the right and then a tightly spaced column of posts 1614 on the left. Alternatively, FRESH can be used to print the muscle fibers directly into the parallel and convergent muscle structures with or without the support posts. Other muscle structures that can be engineered using FRESH include circular muscle bundles such as sphincters appropriate for repair of the orbicularis oculi muscle around the eye, and the orbicularis oris muscle around the mouth. 

[0083] A number of implementations have been described. Nevertheless, various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the processes and techniques described herein. In addition, the processes depicted in the figures do not require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results. In addition, other steps can be provided, or steps can be eliminated, from the described processes, and other components can be added to, or removed from, the describe apparatus and systems. Accordingly, other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 

[0019] It is to be understood that at least some of the figures and descriptions of the invention have been simplified to focus on elements that are relevant for a clear understanding of the invention, while eliminating, for purposes of clarity, other elements that those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate may also comprise a portion of the invention. However, because such elements are well known in the art, and because they do not necessarily facilitate a better understanding of the invention, a description of such elements is not provided herein. 

[0020] According to various embodiments, the invention described herein may be utilized to control movement of an articulated device, which in the figures and description herein is described as a steerable multi-linked device. In an embodiment, a surgical probe may be an exemplary articulated device. A surgical probe may be used to perform surgical procedures, exploratory procedures and/or the like on humans and/or animals. For ease of explanation purposes, the invention will be described in the context of its use with various embodiments of the steerable multi-linked device described herein. However, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be utilized with other types of multi-linked devices as well as other types of devices such as, but not limited to, endoscopes, highly articulated devices and/or the like. 

[0021] FIG. 1 illustrates a representative embodiment of a highly articulated extendible probe device 10. The cross-section of such an embodiment is depicted in FIG. 1. According to the representative embodiment, the device may be a steerable multi-linked device such as a snake-like robot, a continuum robot or the like. Various embodiments of the device 10 may be utilized for medical procedures (e.g., as a robotic bore, positioning device, ablation tool, camera or instrument support, or guidance system for minimally invasive procedures), for surveillance applications, for inspection applications, for search and rescue applications, etc. For purposes of clarity only, the utility of the device 10 will be described hereinbelow in the context of its applicability to medical procedures. However, a person skilled in the art will appreciate that the device 10 can be utilized in a variety of different applications. 

[0022] The device 10 comprises a first mechanism 12 and a second mechanism 14. According to the representative embodiment, a mechanism may be a series of articulated links, a snake-like robot, a continuum robot or the like. According to the representative embodiment, the second mechanism 14 is structured and arranged to receive and surround the first mechanism 12 as shown in FIG. 2. Thus, the first mechanism and second mechanism may be concentric. According to other embodiments, the first and second mechanisms 12, 14 may be structured and arranged to have a relationship other than a concentric relationship. For example, the second mechanism 14 may surround the first mechanism 12, however, the first mechanism 12 may be arranged eccentrically with respect to the second mechanism 14. According to the representative embodiment, the first and second mechanisms 12, 14 may be structured and arranged to operate in a side-by-side arrangement, where the first mechanism 12 operates alongside the second mechanism 14. According to the representative embodiment, additional and/or alternate configurations may be used within the scope of this disclosure. According to the representative embodiment, a gap or three-dimensional space 240 may be provided between the first and second mechanisms. This space will be described in more detail below. 

[0023] As described in more detail hereinbelow, the first mechanism 12 may operate in either a rigid mode or a limp mode, the second mechanism 14 may operate in either a rigid mode or a limp mode, and the first and second mechanisms 12, 14 may operate independent of one another. At least one of the mechanism is rigid at all times during operation of the device 10. Both the first mechanism 12 and the second mechanism 14 may be steerable mechanisms. Accordingly, it will be appreciated that the device 10 may be utilized to navigate a luminal space as well as any path within a three-dimensional intracavity space, void, or an otherwise unconstrained three-dimensional volume. According to the representative embodiment, the device 10 may advance by alternating the operation of the first mechanism 12 and the second mechanism 14 between a limp mode and a rigid mode. Further, both mechanisms can both exist in the rigid mode at the same time. 

[0024] According to the representative embodiment, the device 10 may also comprise one or more cables. According to the representative embodiment, one or more of the cables 10 may be steering cables and/or tensioning cables. For example, the device 10 may include three cables for steering disposed through the second mechanism and one cable for tensioning which is disposed through the first mechanism. Alternatively, the device 10 may include four steering cables. More, fewer, alternative and/or additional cables may be used within the scope of this disclosure. 

[0025] FIG. 3 illustrates various embodiments of either mechanism of the device. Shown in FIG. 3 is the first mechanism 12 of the device 10. The first mechanism 12 is a multi-linked mechanism and includes a first end 24 and a second end 26. The first end 24 may be considered the proximal end and the second end 26 may be considered the distal end. The first mechanism 12 may comprise a first link 28, a second link 30, and one or more intermediate links 32 between the first and second links 28, 30. The first link 28 may be considered the proximal link, and the second link 30 may be considered the distal link. Any link between the proximal link 28 and distal link 30 may be considered an intermediate link 32. Exemplar link structures are shown in, for example, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0039690. 

[0026] FIGS. 4 and 5 illustrate various views of an exemplary intermediate link 32 of the first mechanism 12 in an embodiment where the inner mechanism serves as the core. The intermediate link 32 is representative of the other intermediate links 32. The intermediate link 32 includes a first end 58 and a second end 60, and defines a longitudinal axis 62 that passes through the center of the first end 58 and the center of the second end 60. Link 32 includes a passage 76 or through-hole which may be positioned along the longitudinal axis, or it may be positioned elsewhere in the link parallel to, or substantially parallel to, the longitudinal axis. 

[0027] As shown in FIG. 4, the intermediate link 32 also comprises a first surface 68 that extends from the first end 58 of the intermediate link 32 to the second end 60 of the intermediate link 32. The first surface 68, shown in FIG. 5, may be considered the outer surface of the intermediate link 32. The intermediate link 32 also defines one or more port portions, referred to herein as grooves. In the example shown, link 32 includes a first groove 70 parallel to the longitudinal axis 62 along the first surface 68, a second groove 72 parallel to the longitudinal axis 62 along the first surface 68, and a third groove 74 substantially aligned to the longitudinal axis 62 along the first surface 68. Each of the first, second and third grooves 70, 72, 74 extend along the first surface 68 from the first end 58 of the intermediate link 32 toward the second end 60 of the intermediate link 32. The first, second and third grooves 70, 72, 74 may be semi-tubular shaped and may be arranged in a radially symmetric manner around the longitudinal axis 62 on the first surface 68 of the intermediate link 32 as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5. The size of each of the grooves 70, 72, 74 may be identical to one another or may be different from one another. For example, according to various embodiments, the first and second grooves 70, 72 are configured as segments of a cylinder having a diameter on the order of approximately 1.75 millimeters at the first end 58 of the intermediate link 32, and the third groove 74 is configured as a segment of a cylinder having a diameter on the order of approximately 2.50 millimeters at the first end 58 of the intermediate link 32. The first, second and third grooves 70, 72, 74 are each configured to provide a portion of a port structure that receives and partially surrounds any of a variety of 

[0028] The intermediate link 32 also defines a through-hole or passage 76 extending from the first end 58 to the second end 60 and is parallel to the longitudinal axis. The through-hole or passage 76 may be of a size sufficient to allow one or more cables to pass there-through. 

[0029] FIG. 6 illustrates various steps of a motion sequence of the steerable multi-linked device 10. At the start of the sequence, the second mechanism 14 surrounds the first mechanism 12 as shown in step "a" of FIG. 6, the longitudinal axes of the links 28, 30, 32 of the first mechanism 12 are substantially aligned with the respective longitudinal axes 134, 164, 212 of the links (e.g, link 126) of the second mechanism, and the second end 26 of the first mechanism 12 is at substantially the same position as the second end 122 of the second mechanism 14. A tensioning cable passes through a through-hole of the first mechanism. It is terminated on an actuation component at the proximal area or end of the first mechanism and at a next-to-last link at a distal end. The tensioning cable is pulled tight, thereby placing at least a portion of the first mechanism 12 in the rigid mode by placing a force on the distal link and at least a some intermediate links. The steering cables are not pulled tight, thereby placing the second mechanism 14 in the limp mode. 

[0030] The second mechanism 14 is then advanced so that its second link 126 is positioned approximately one link ahead of the second end 24 of the first mechanism 12 as shown in step "b" of FIG. 6. The cables 16, 18, 20 may be utilized to orient the second link 126 to a particular orientation, where the longitudinal axis 134 of the first link 124 is no longer aligned with the longitudinal axes 164 of the intermediate links 128 of the second mechanism 14 or the longitudinal axis 90 of the second link 30 of the first mechanism 12. After the second link 126 is in the desired position and orientation, the steering cables are pulled with appropriate forces in order to place the second mechanism 14 in the rigid mode, thereby preserving the position and orientation of the second mechanism 14 when the first mechanism is made limp. 

[0031] The pulling force of the tensioning cable is then released to place the first mechanism 12 in the limp mode. After the first mechanism 12 is placed in the limp mode, the first mechanism 12 is advanced so that its second link 30 is at substantially the same position as the second end 122 of the second mechanism 14 as shown in step "c" of FIG. 6. After the second link 30 of the first mechanism 12 is in the desired position, the tensioning cable is pulled tight to place the first mechanism 12 back in the rigid mode, thereby preserving the position and orientation of the first mechanism 12. 

[0032] The pulling forces of the steering cables are then released to place the second mechanism 14 back in the limp mode. After the second mechanism 14 is placed back in the limp mode, the second mechanism 14 is advanced so that its second link'126 is once again positioned approximately one link ahead of the second end 26 of the first mechanism 12 as shown in step "d" of FIG. 6. After the second link 126 is in the desired position and orientation, the steering cables are pulled with identical force in order to place the second mechanism 14 in the rigid mode, thereby preserving the position and orientation of the second mechanism 14. 

[0033] The pulling force of the tensioning cable is then released to place the first mechanism 12 back in the limp mode. After the first mechanism 12 is placed back in the limp mode, the first mechanism 12 is advanced so that its second link 30 is once again at substantially the same position as the second end 122 of the second mechanism 14 as shown in step "e" of FIG. 6. After the second link 30 of the first mechanism 12 is in the desired position and orientation, the tensioning cable is pulled tight to place the first mechanism 12 back in the rigid mode, thereby preserving the position and orientation of the first mechanism 

[0034] In an embodiment, the flexible, snake-like device 10 may include one or more overtubes. In an embodiment, an overtube may include a series of links in a similar fashion to the second mechanism. In an embodiment, an overtube may be a snake-like robot, a continuum robot or the like. An overtube may be fabricated from metal, plastic, fiber, reinforced fiber, any combination thereof and/or the like. 

[0035] In an embodiment, an overtube may include one or more through-holes. A through-hole may extend along a length of the overtube. In an embodiment, a through-hole may be substantially cylindrically shaped. A through-hole may be configured to surround and receive a cable. For example, as illustrated by FIG. 13, a through-hole 1800 may receive a steering cable 1805. In an embodiment, a steering cable may assist in controlling and guiding the movement of an overtube. 

[0036] In an embodiment, an overtube 1820 may include one or more grooves, such as the grooves described above with respect to the intermediate link 32. The grooves of an overtube may align with grooves on the outside of a second mechanism to form one or more ports such as port 1900. A port may be a passageway that extends along a length of a device. In an embodiment, an overtube may wholly contain one or more ports. In an embodiment, ports may be configured to surround and receive one or more tools. Additionally, overtube 1820 may include one or more through-holes 1800. For example, FIG. 7 illustrates an exemplary through-hole 1905 receiving a tensioning cable 1915 and an exemplary port 1900 receiving a tool 1910. 

[0037] In an embodiment, an overtube may surround both the first mechanism 12 and the second mechanism 14. For example, as illustrated by FIGS. 9A-9C, the second mechanism 1405 may surround the first mechanism 1415, and the overtube 1400 may surround the second mechanism 1405. In an embodiment, as shown in FIG. 2, the first mechanism 12 may be positioned concentrically with respect to the second mechanism 14. Alternatively, as shown in FIGS. 9A-9C, the first mechanism 1415 may be positioned eccentrically with respect to the second mechanism 1405. For example, the first mechanism 1415 may be located off-center from the second mechanism 1405. In an embodiment, the second mechanism 1405 may be positioned concentrically with respect to the overtube 1400. Alternatively, the second mechanism 1405 may be positioned eccentrically with respect to the overtube 1400. In an embodiment, the overtube may be fabricated from plastic, such as polysulfone and/or the like. 

[0038] In an embodiment, the first mechanism 1415 and the second mechanism 1405 may be collectively considered an inner mechanism, and the overtube 1400 may be considered an outer mechanism. In an embodiment, the device may operate in a first mode. The first mechanism 1415 and the second mechanism 1405 may operate substantially in unison and both mechanisms may alternate between a rigid and a limp state together. The operation of the first mechanism 1415 and second mechanism 1405 may be complimentary to the overtube 1400. For example, the first mechanism 1415 and the second mechanism 1405 may both be made limp while the overtube 1400 is made rigid. Alternatively, the first mechanism 1415 and the second mechanism 1405 may both be made rigid when the overtube 1400 is made limp. Still further, the all mechanism may be made rigid at the same time. 

[0039] For example, while in a limp state, the first mechanism 1415 and second mechanism 1405 may advance into the overtube 1400 to a certain position. The first mechanism 1415 and the second mechanism 1405 may be made rigid, while the overtube 1400 may be made limp. The overtube 1400 may advance over the first mechanism 1415 and the second mechanism 1405. This motion sequence is analogous to the motion sequence describe above and depicted in FIG. 6. 

[0040] In an embodiment, the device may operate in a second mode. In a second mode, the overtube 1400 may act as a steerable cannula that may be positioned with assistance from the first mechanism 1415 and the second mechanism 1405. For example, after reaching a target location, the overtube 1400 may be made rigid. The first mechanism 1415 and second mechanism 1405 may continue to advance, while the overtube 1400 may remain stationary. As illustrated in FIG. 8, the overtube 1400 may provide additional length to the flexible, snake-like device 10, allowing for more flexibility in its positioning and use. The overtube 1400 may also provide additional support to the first mechanism (contained within the second mechanism 1405) and the second mechanism 1405. As illustrated by FIG. 7, the radius of curvature associated with an overtube 1400 may, in some embodiments, be at least as large as the radius of curvature associated with the second mechanism 1405 

[0041] FIGS. 9A-9C illustrate exemplary cross-sections of an articulated device having an overtube according to an embodiment. In FIG. 9A, a cross-section of an overtube 1400 is highlighted. As illustrated by FIG. 9A, an overtube 1400 may include one or more through-holes 1401, 1402, 1403. Steering cables used to control the overtube 1400 may be received by the through-holes 1401, 1402, 1403. 

[0042] In FIG. 9B, a cross-section of a second mechanism 1405 is highlighted. As illustrated by FIG. 9B, a second mechanism 1405 may include one or more through-holes 1408, 1409, 1410. Steering cables used to control movement of the second mechanism 1405 may be received by the through-holes 1408, 1409, 1410. In an embodiment, the second mechanism 1405 may include one or more ports 1406, 1407. A port may be a passageway that extends along the length of a device. In an embodiment, a port may be formed by the alignment of one or more grooves of a first mechanism and one or more grooves or walls of a second mechanism. In an alternate embodiment shown in FIG. 9B, a port may be wholly formed in a first mechanism and/or a second mechanism. In an embodiment, one or more through-holes may be configured to surround and receive one or more tensioning cables and at least one port may be configured to surround tools and/or the like. 

[0043] In FIG. 9C, a cross-section of the first mechanism 1415 is highlighted. As illustrated by FIG. 9C, a first device 1415 may include a through-hole 1420 for delivery of a tool. 

[0044] In an embodiment, an overtube may be used to deliver a plurality of flexible, snake-like devices 10 to a location as illustrated by FIG. 10. Although FIG. 10 illustrates an overtube surrounding two devices 1500, 1505 in a parallel configuration, additional devices and/or alternate configurations may be used within the scope of this disclosure. 

[0045] In an embodiment, each device may be operated in a first mode, such as that described above. In an embodiment, each device may be operated in substantial unison with each of the other devices. For example, while in a limp state, a first device 1500 and a second device 1505 may advance into the overtube 1510 to a certain position. The first device 1500 and the second device 1505 may be made rigid, while the overtube 1510 may be made limp. The overtube 1510 may advance over the first device 1500 and the second device 1505. 

[0046] In an embodiment, the devices 1510, 1505 and the overtube 1510 may operate in a second mode, similar to that described above. In an embodiment, the overtube 1510 may act as a steerable cannula that may be positioned with assistance from the first device 1500 and the second device 1505. For example, after reaching a target location, the overtube 1510 may be made rigid. The first device 1500 and second device 1505 may continue to advance, while the overtube 1510 may remain stationary. The first device 1500 and the second device 1505 may be independently operated as they advance beyond the overtube 1310. The overtube 1310 may provide additional length to the flexible, snake-like device 10, providing for more flexibility in its positioning and use. The overtube 1510 may also provide additional support to the first device 1500 and the second device 1500. 

[0047] In an embodiment, a plurality or overtubes arranged in a nested structure may be used in conjunction with one or more devices. FIG. 1I illustrates a cross-section of the device having n-overtubes which are nested concentrically within each other according to an embodiment. As illustrated by FIG. 1I, overtube n 1600 may surround at least a portion of overtube n-1 1605. Overtube n-1 1605 may in turn surround at least a portion of overtube 4 1610, and so on. As illustrated by FIG. 11, with a nested arrangement, either concentrically or eccentrically, of n-overtubes, a device may have a telescopic configuration. Any of the overtubes may be steerable or non-steerable, and those which are steerable will have a plurality of associate steering cables. Non-steerable devices require only a tensioning cable in a through-hole, and no steering cable. In an embodiment, the added support provided by additional overtubes may allow a device to reach lengths it otherwise would not be able to reach. 

[0048] In an embodiment, a device may include one or more first mechanisms, one or more second mechanisms and/or one or more overtubes. The first mechanisms, second mechanisms and/or overtubes may be arranged in a nested, parallel and/or in any other configuration or combination of configurations. In an embodiment, one or more first mechanisms, second mechanisms and/or overtubes may be arranged concentrically, eccentrically and/or the like. For example, a first mechanism may be positioned concentrically relative to a second mechanism. Similarly, a device may be positioned eccentrically relative to an overtube. 

[0049] In an embodiment, when a first mechanism is disposed eccentrically relative to a second mechanism, the first mechanism may "break out" of the channel through which it disposed during advancement when the device is highly curved. To resolve this problem, a passive section of inner links may be added to a distal end of the first mechanism. FIG. 12 illustrates an tensioning cable 1700 having a first cable portion 1705 and a second cable portion 1720 spliced together. For example, a hollow, braided cable 1700 may be used. In an embodiment, the distal end of the braided cable 1700 may be opened to form a sleeve 1715, and a shorter, separate section of the same type of cable may be inserted into the open weave of the sleeve 1715 as illustrated by FIG. 12. An active section of cable 1720 and a passive section 1705 may be combined such that their longitudinal axes are substantially aligned. After a portion of the shorter segment is inserted into the open braid of the longer cable, at least one running stitch 1710 may be run through both cables in the section where they overlap. In an embodiment, the portion may be approximately 3-5 mm long. In an embodiment, the stitch may secure the cables together. 

[0050] In an embodiment, the increased diameter of the longer cable with the shorter cabled spliced into it may act as a force transmission point for the cable of the first mechanism on one of the intermediate links. The shorter section of cable may then have one or more links strung onto it. In an embodiment, three to five links may be strung onto the shorter section of cable. In an embodiment, the passive links may be secured with a stopper knot terminating the distal most end at the second link. Because the links of the active portion of the first mechanism may be secured between the feeder and the splice point, the intermediate links that are strung on the shorter section beyond the splice point may not be subject to the same loads. As such, these intermediate links may not become rigid. 

[0051] In an embodiment, an additional benefit of having the cable spliced may be increased cable strength. For example, with a 150 lb test cable, the cable may break close to the knot at approximately 60 lbs. With a splice, however, the cable may break far from the termination point at approximately 100 lbs. 

[0052] In an embodiment, a first mechanism, a second mechanism and/or an overtube may have any number of ports, through-holes and/or the like. In an embodiment, the ports and/or through-holes may be arranged such that they are radially symmetric, radially asymmetric and/or the like. 

[0053] In an embodiment, placement of ports and/or through-holes relative to the first mechanism 12 and/or the second mechanism 14 may vary. For example, one or more ports may be placed concentrically or eccentrically on the device 10. In addition, one or more ports may be fully contained within one or more mechanisms of the device 10. For example, one or more ports may be fully contained within the second mechanism 14. Similarly, one or more ports may be fully contained within the first mechanism 12. In an embodiment, one or more ports may be split between a plurality of mechanisms of the device 10. For example, one or more ports may be split between the first mechanism 12 and the second mechanism 14. In such an embodiment, when the internal grooves of the second mechanism are substantially aligned with the external grooves of the first mechanism, a number of larger ports equal to the number of grooves on the first/second mechanism will be shared by the two mechanisms. In another embodiment, when the internal grooves of the second mechanism are substantially misaligned with the external grooves of the first mechanism, a number of smaller ports equal to twice the number of grooves on the first/second mechanism will exist. In an embodiment, one or more ports may be exposed to the exterior of a mechanism of the device 10. For example, one or more ports may be exposed to the exterior of the second mechanism 14. Additional and/or alternate port placements may be used within the scope of this disclosure. 

[0054] Examples of different port and through-hole configurations are illustrated by FIGS. 13A-13J. For example, FIG. 13A illustrates an exemplary second mechanism 14 having four through-holes 1700, 1702, 1704, 1706. As illustrated by FIG. 13A, the through-holes may be eccentrically arranged in a radially symmetric manner. Steering cables may be delivered through the through-holes. 

[0055] FIG. 13B illustrates an exemplary second mechanism 14 having three through-holes 1708, 1710, 1712 according to an embodiment. As illustrated by FIG. 13B, the through-holes 1708, 1710, 1712 may be arranged eccentrically in a radially symmetric manner inside the structure of the second mechanism 14. 

[0056] FIG. 13C illustrates an exemplary second mechanism 14 having three ports 1714, 1716, 1718 contained in an outer wall 1720 of the second mechanism 14. The second mechanism 14 may also include one or more through-holes such as those 1713, 1715, 1717 illustrated by FIG. 13C. In an embodiment, the through-holes 1713, 1715, 1717 may be arranged eccentrically in a radially symmetric manner. In an embodiment, the through-holes may be evenly spaced within the arrangement of the ports 1714, 1716, 1718. 

[0057] FIG. 13D illustrates an exemplary second mechanism 14 having three ports 1722, 1724, 1726 located on the exterior of the second mechanism 14. FIG. 13D also illustrates three through-holes 1764, 1766, 1768. In an embodiment, the three through-holes 1764, 1766, 1768 may support three steering cables. The through-holes 1764, 1766, 1768 may be arranged eccentrically in a radially symmetric fashion as illustrated by FIG. 13D. In an embodiment, the triangle that is formed may include a center point of a cross-section of a mechanism. For example, the triangle formed by the through-holes 1764, 1766, 1768 in FIG. 13D include a center point 1770 of the second mechanism 14. In an embodiment, the through-holes may be arranged as vertices of an equilateral triangle. In an embodiment, there may exist an even number of through-holes, such that each through-hole may have a corresponding through-hole located on the diametric opposite of a mechanism. In an embodiment, each through-hole and diametrically opposite through hole may oppose each other. 

[0058] FIG. 13E illustrates an exemplary second mechanism 14 having two ports arranged eccentrically in a radially asymmetric manner 1728, 1730. As illustrated by FIG. 13E, the first mechanism 12 may be located eccentrically relative to the second mechanism 14. The ports 1728, 1730 may be located eccentrically relative to a first mechanism. As illustrated by FIG. 13E, the ports 1728, 1730 may be completely contained in the second mechanism 14. As such, no alignment/misalignment of the first mechanism and the second mechanism 14 may be necessary to define any plurality of ports 1728, 1730. As illustrated by FIG. 13E, the second mechanism 14 may include one or more through-holes 1727, 1729, 1731. The through-holes 1764, 1766, 1768 may be spaced to form a triangle as illustrated by FIG. 12E. In an embodiment, the through-holes 1764, 1766, 1768 may be wholly contained in the second mechanism 14. 

[0059] FIG. 12F illustrates an exemplary first mechanism 12 having a single through-hole 1732 for, as an example, a tensioning cable. In an embodiment, the exemplary first mechanism 12 illustrated by FIG. 12F may correspond to the second mechanism 12 illustrated by FIG. 13E. If the through-hole is positioned concentrically, it is non-steerable, but is lockable when tension is applied. If the through-hole is positioned eccentrically, the first mechanism may be steerable, but not lockable. 

[0060] FIG. 13G illustrates an exemplary first mechanism 12 having three through-holes 1734, 1736, 1738 for, as an example, three steering cables. In an embodiment, the first mechanism' 12 and/or the second mechanism 14 may be steered with the steering cables. In contrast to a single through-hole configuration from FIG. 13F, the configuration depicted in FIG. 13G is both steerable and lockable. 

[0061] FIG. 13H illustrates exemplary ports 1740, 1742, 1744 defined by a first mechanism 12 and a second mechanism 14. As illustrated by FIG. 12H, the ports 1740, 1742, 1744 may be located on an exterior portion of the first mechanism 12 and within the structure of the second mechanism 14. 

[0062] FIG. 13I illustrates exemplary ports 1746, 1748, 1750 defined by a first mechanism 12. As illustrated by FIG. 12I, the ports 1746, 1748, 1750 may be located on an exterior portion of the first mechanism 12. In an embodiment, the first mechanism may have a single through-hole 1747 for, as an example, a tensioning cable. 

[0063] FIG. 13J illustrates exemplary ports 1758, 1760, 1762 defined by a first mechanism 12. As illustrated by FIG. 13J, the ports may be located on an exterior portion of the first mechanism 12. The first mechanism 12 may also include one or more through-holes 1752, 1754, 1756. Additional and/or alternate port and through-hole locations may be used within the scope of this disclosure. 

[0064] In an embodiment, a device 10 having two through-holes eccentrically arranged in a radially symmetric manner for steering cables may be capable of defining a 2D surface which is planar. In contrast, a device 10 having two through-holes for steering cables may be capable of defining a 2D surface which is non-planar if the through holes are radially asymmetric. In an embodiment, a device 10 having an odd number of radially symmetrically or asymmetrically arranged steering cables may require a dedicated actuator for each cable. For example, if a device 10 has n steering cables, where n is an odd number, or where n is an even number and the holes are arranged in a radially asymmetric fashion, n actuators may be necessary to load the n steering cables. In an embodiment, an actuator may be a device capable of providing a load, a force and/or the like. Exemplary actuators may include DC motors, stepper motors, EPAM devices, muscles, MicroElectricalMechanical systems ("MEMS") devices and/or the like. 

[0065] For example, FIG. 13B illustrates a device 10 having three through-holes, each of which may support a steering cable. As the device in FIG. 13B has an odd number of steering cables (i.e., 3), each steering cable may require an actuator. 

[0066] In an embodiment, a device 10 may have an even number of steering cables arranged in a radially symmetric manner. In an embodiment, each of the steering cables may have a corresponding actuator. Alternatively, diametrically opposing pairs of cables may be actuated with a single common actuator. For example, FIG. 13A illustrates a device 10 having four through-holes for four steering cables. A first steering cable associated with a first through-hole (e.g., 1700) may be located opposite a second steering cable associated with a second through-hole (e.g., 1704). The first steering cable and the second steering cable may be considered an opposing pair. In an embodiment, the first steering cable may be considered a counterpart to the second steering cable. In an embodiment, the first steering cable and the second steering cable may be loaded with a single actuator. In an embodiment, the number of actuators needed to load n steering cables (where n is an even number) may be a number greater than or equal to n and less than or equal to 

n 2 ##EQU00001## 

because each steering cable may have its own actuator or it may share an actuator with an opposing steering cable. An additional actuation element is necessary to simultaneously apply tension to all cables in order to lock the mechanism. In such an embodiment the total number of actuators necessary is 

n 2 + 1 ##EQU00002## 

[0067] In an embodiment, one or more steering cables may be arranged to maximize workspace. For devices 10 having an even number of steering cables, as one steering cable is made longer from the steering process, the length of its counterpart steering cable may be made shorter by an equal amount. For example, referring to FIG. 13A, a first steering cable associated with a first through-hole (e.g., 1700) may be located opposite a second steering cable associated with a second through-hole (e.g., 1704). As the first steering cable is made longer by x amount, the second steering cable may be made shorter by x amount. 

[0068] While several embodiments of the invention have been described herein by way of example, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, alterations, and adaptations to the described embodiments may be realized without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention defined by the appended claims.

Emotion Recognition System and Method for Modulating the Behavior of Intelligent Systems 

Abstract
The disclosure describes an audio-based emotion recognition system that is able to classify emotions in real-time. The emotion recognition system, according to some embodiments, adjusts the behavior of intelligent systems, such as a virtual coach, depending on the user's emotion, thereby providing an improved user experience. Embodiments of the emotion recognition system and method use short utterances as real-time speech from the user and use prosodic and phonetic features, such as fundamental frequency, amplitude, and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, as the main set of features by which the human speech is characterized. In addition, certain embodiments of the present invention use One-Against-All or Two-Stage classification systems to determine different emotions. A minimum-error feature removal mechanism is further provided in alternate embodiments to reduce bandwidth and increase accuracy of the emotion recognition system.

Description


CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS 

[0001] This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. .sctn.119 of Provisional Ser. No. 62/123,986, filed Dec. 4, 2014, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 

[0003] The invention relates generally to intelligent reactive systems. More specifically, the invention relates to a system and method that recognize the emotions of a user from auditory signals, allowing a response of an intelligent system to be adjusted based on the user's emotional state. 

[0004] Emotions often drive human behavior and detection of the emotional state of a person is very important for system interaction in general and in particular in the design of intelligent systems, such as virtual coaches used in stroke rehabilitation, for example. As the virtual coach is used to improve the quality of life of a user, emotion recognition is an important facet of that intelligent system. A model of human behavior that can be instantiated for each individual includes emotional state as one of its primary components. Example emotional states that emotion recognition systems address are: anger, fear, happy, neutral, sadness and disgust. 

[0005] The task of emotion recognition is a challenging one and has received immense interest from researchers. One prior method uses a supra-segmental Hidden Markov Model approach along with an emotion dependent acoustic model. This method extracts prosodic and acoustic features from a corpus of word tokens, and uses them to develop an emotion dependent model that assigns probabilities to the emotions--happy, afraid, sad, and angry. The label of the emotion model with the highest generating probability is assigned to the test sentence. 

[0006] Other prior methods present an analysis of fundamental frequency in emotion detection, reporting an accuracy of 77.31% for a binary classification between `expressive` or emotional speech and neutral speech. With this method, only pitch related features were considered. The overall emphasis of the research in this method was to analyze the discriminative power of pitch related features in contrasting neutral speech with emotional speech. The approach was tested with four acted emotional databases spanning different emotional categories, recording settings, speakers, and languages. There is a reliance on neutral models for pitch features built using Hidden Markov Models in the approach; otherwise, the accuracy decreases by up to 17.9%. 

[0007] In other examples, automatic emotion classification systems and methods use the information about a speaker's emotion that is contained in utterance-level statistics over segmental spectral features. In yet another example, researchers use class-level spectral features computed over consonant regions to improve accuracy. In this example, performance is compared on two publicly available datasets for six emotion labels--anger, fear, disgust, happy, sadness, and neutral. Average accuracy for those six emotions using prosodic features on the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) dataset was 65.38%. Some research identifies the accuracy of human's emotion detection at 70%. 

[0008] While these prior systems produce fairly good results, accuracy can be improved. Moreover, these prior systems do not approach real-time results and some do not provide recognition of an expanded set of emotions. It would therefore be advantageous to develop an emotion recognition system that provides accurate real-time classification for use in reactive intelligent systems. 

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 

[0009] According to embodiments of the present disclosure is an audio-based emotion recognition system that is able to classify emotions as anger, fear, happy, neutral, sadness, disgust, and other emotions in real time. The emotion recognition system can be used to adapt an intelligent system based on the classification. A virtual coach is an application example of how emotion recognition can be used to modulate intelligent systems' behavior. For example, the virtual coach can suggest that a user take a break if the emotion recognition system detects anger. The system and method of the present invention, according to some embodiments, rely on a minimum-error feature removal mechanism to reduce bandwidth and increase accuracy. Accuracy is further improved through the use of a Two-Stage Hierarchical classification approach in alternate embodiments. In other embodiments, a One-Against-All (OAA) framework is used. In testing, embodiments of the present invention achieve an average accuracy of 82.07% using the OAA approach and 87.70% with the Two-Stage Hierarchical approach. In both instances, the feature set was pruned and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) was used for classification. 

[0010] The system of the present invention has the following salient characteristics: (1) it uses short utterances as real-time speech from the user; and (2) prosodic and phonetic features, such as fundamental frequency, amplitude, and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients are used as the main set of features by which the human speech samples are characterized. In relying on these features, the system and method of the present invention focus on using only audio as input for emotion recognition without any additional facial or text features. However, video features are used by the intelligent system to determine other aspects of the user's state. For example, in some embodiments, a video camera is used to determine if a stroke patient is performing physical exercises properly. The results of the video monitoring can be combined with the emotion recognition to adjust the feedback given to the user. In this manner, the intelligent system can adjust the interaction style, which encompasses the user's behavior, rather than react to the instant emotional state of the user. For example, on detecting the user's emotion as angry, the system advises the patient to `take a rest` from performing the physical exercise. 

[0011] The models of the present invention can classify several emotions. A subset of those emotions--anger, fear, happy and neutral--was chosen in some embodiments for the virtual coach application based on consultations with clinicians and physical therapists. Additional types of intelligent, reactive systems, such as but not limited to autonomous reactive robots and vehicles and intelligent rooms, will benefit from the emotion recognition system described herein.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 

[0021] In one embodiment, the emotion recognition system comprises a feature extractor 100 and a classifier 200. The feature extractor 100 and classifier 200 are modules that are incorporated into the intelligent system 300. Alternatively, the feature extractor 100 and classifier 200 are integrated into a standalone emotion recognition system. In the preferred embodiment, the emotion recognition system is a computing device with the feature extractor 100 and classifier 200 comprising software or other computer readable instructions. Likewise, in the preferred embodiment, the intelligent system 300 is a computing device capable of executing instructions stored on memory or other storage devices. In this embodiment, the intelligent system comprises the feature extractor 100, classifier 200, a user interface 303 as software modules and an audio input 301 and imaging device 302, as shown in FIG. 1. A training module 400 can be included; alternatively, the training module 400 can be part of the classifier 200. 

[0022] FIG. 2 is a flow diagram showing the method of feature extraction, according to one embodiment. At step 101, an audio file is read into the extractor 100. The audio file can be data derived from speech captured by a microphone 301 or other audio capture device connected to the emotion recognition system or intelligent system 300. At step 102, the silent portions of the audio file are removed. Removing the silent portions of the audio improves the speed and efficiency of the system by truncating the audio data file and discarding data that does not contribute to emotion recognition. Further, removal of intervals of silence from a speech signal and filters is done so that distortion from the concatenation of active speech segments is reduced. The speech signal plays faster because pauses are removed. This is useful in computing mean quantities related to speech in that it removes the pauses of silence between words and syllables, which can be quite variable between people and affect performance computations. Since the emotion recognition system analyzes prosodic and acoustic features from the given audio, the silences under a defined threshold have no information for the feature extraction. 

[0023] As step 103, the audio data is resampled. At step 104, phonetic features, such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), are calculated. The coefficients are generated by binning the signal with triangular bins of increasing width as the frequency increases. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients are often used in both speech and emotion classification. As such, a person having skill in the art will appreciate that many methods of calculating the coefficients can be used. In the preferred embodiment, a total of 42 prosodic and phonetic features are used. These include 10 prosodic features describing the fundamental frequency and amplitude of the audio data. The prosodic features are useful in real-time emotion classification because they accurately reflect the state of emotion in an utterance, or short segment of audio. By using utterances, it is not necessary for the emotion recognition system to record the content of the words being spoken. 

[0024] At step 105, FO values are determined using a pitch determination algorithm based on subharmonic-to-harmonic ratios. The following acoustic variables are strongly involved in vocal emotion signaling: the level, range, and contour of the fundamental frequency (referred to as F0; it reflects the frequency of the vibration of the vocal folds and is perceived as pitch). For example, happy speech has been found to be correlated with increased mean fundamental frequency (F0), increased mean voice intensity and higher variability of F0, while boredom is usually linked to decreased mean F0 and increased mean of the first formant frequency (F1). 

[0025] Using the prosodic and phonetic features together, as opposed to using only prosodic features, helps achieve higher classification accuracy. The approach of the present invention towards feature extraction focuses on the utterance-level statistical parameters such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and range. A Hamming window of length 25 ms is shifted in steps of 10 ms, and the first 16 Cepstral coefficients, along with the fundamental frequency and amplitude are computed in each windowed segment. Statistical information is then captured for each of these attributes across all segments. 

[0026] At step 106, the mean and standard deviation are calculated for each of the 16 Cepstral coefficients providing 32 features. In addition, the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and range were calculated for fundamental frequency and amplitude, thus providing the remaining 10 features. This results in 42 features for the dataset in the preferred embodiment. In alternate embodiments, the number of features extracted from the audio data can differ depending on the particular application in which the emotion recognition system is being used. For example, in application where low processing demands are prioritized, fewer features may be extracted. 

[0027] Once the features are extracted, they are used to classify the speech. FIG. 3 is a flow diagram showing the general method of classification, according to the Two-Stage Hierarchical embodiment. In the two-stage classification, test data is input at step 201. Next, the data is classified into one of two categories of emotions at step 202. In the preferred embodiment, the first class comprises neutral and happy and the second class comprises angry and sad. If the data is classified into the first class, the second stage of classification recognizes the data as neutral or sad at step 203 in a first classifier 200. If the data is identified as belonging to the second class, then the next stage classifies the data as angry or sad at step 204 in a second classifier 200. Thus, the emotion recognition system contains three classifiers 200, one in the first stage and two classifiers 200 in the second stage. 

[0028] For the purpose of classification, Support Vector Machines with Linear, Quadratic and Radial Basis Function kernels, are used due to the property of SVMs to generate hyperplanes for optimal classification. Depending on the particular application of the virtual coach, optimization can be run with different parameters for different kernels and the best performing model, along with its parameters, is stored for each classification to be used later with the virtual coach. 

[0029] By way of example of the operation of the emotion recognition system, the performance of three classification methodologies were evaluated on the syntactically annotated audio dataset produced by Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) and on a custom audio dataset. 

[0030] 1) LDC Audio Dataset 

[0031] The primary dataset used for performance evaluation was the LDC audio dataset. The corpus contains audio files along with the transcripts of the spoken words as well as the emotions with which those words were spoken by seven professional actors. The transcript files were used to extract short utterances and the corresponding emotion labels. The utterances contained short, four-syllable words representing dates and numbers, e.g. `August 16th`. The left channel of the audio files was used after sampling the signal down to 16 kHz, on which classification algorithms were run. 

[0032] The One-Against-All algorithm according to one embodiment classifies six basic emotions--anger, fear, happy, neutral, sadness and disgust. As such, the emotion classes from the LDC corpus corresponding to these six emotions were selected. Table I shows this mapping along with the number of audio files from the dataset corresponding to each of the six emotions. A total of 947 utterances were used. 

TABLE-US-00001 TABLE I Mapping of LDC emotions to six basic emotions. Basic Emotion LDC Emotion Number of utterances Anger Hot anger 139 Disgust Disgust 179 Fear Anxiety 183 Happy Happy 179 Neutral Neutral 112 Sadness Sadness 155 

[0033] 2) Banana Oil Dataset 

[0034] This dataset is a custom created dataset to be used as an alternative to the LDC. 1,440 audio files were recorded from 18 subjects, with 20 short utterances for neutral, angry, happy and fear emotions in the context of the virtual coach application. Each audio file was 1-2 seconds long. The subjects were asked to speak the phrase "banana oil" exhibiting all four emotions. This phrase was selected because of its lack of association between the words and the emotions assayed in the study (i.e. anger or neutral), thereby allowing each actor to "act out" the emotion without any bias to the meaning of the phrase. 

[0035] The subjects were given 15 minutes for the entire session, wherein they were made to listen to pre-recorded voices for two minutes, twice, after which they were given two minutes to rehearse and perform test recordings. In addition, for fear emotion, a video was shown as an attempt to incite that particular emotion. After recording the voice samples, subjects were asked if they felt the samples were satisfactory, and in case they were not, the recording was performed again for the unsatisfactory ones. 

[0036] Finally, after all samples had been recorded, they were renamed to conceal the corresponding emotion labels. For the purpose of emotional evaluation, seven `evaluators` listened to the samples at the same time, and each one independently noted what she felt was the true emotion label for that particular file. Throughout this process, the labels from one evaluator were not known to the rest. Finally, a consensus of labels was taken for each file, which was then decided as the ground truth label for that particular file. In addition, the consensus strength was also determined, based on the ones with the strongest consensus which were used for the final dataset of 464 files, 116 for each emotion. The evaluators were fluent speakers of English language. 

[0037] While the focus of the emotion recognition system is to classify varying emotions, it is also desirable to concentrate on classifying positive (happy/neutral) against negative emotions (anger/fear) in the context of virtual coach for stroke rehabilitation. Therefore, the emotion recognition system operates with two distinct classifiers 200, namely a One-Against-All (OAA) and Two-Stage Hierarchical classification. 

[0038] To create each classifier 200, the system must be trained. In one training method, a 10-fold cross-validation approach is used on the training set for model, and files corresponding to each emotion are grouped randomly into 10 folds of equal size. Finally, the results are accumulated over all 10 folds, from which a confusion matrix is calculated. The results over all passes were combined by summing the entries in the confusion matrices from each fold. 

[0039] With the One-Against-All approach, the classifier 200 is trained to separate one class from the remaining classes, resulting in six such classifiers 200, one for each emotion when six emotions are being classified. This can result in an imbalance in the number of training examples for positive and negative classes, depending on the training data set used. In order to remove any bias introduced by this class imbalance, the accuracy results from the binary classifier 200 were normalized over the number of classes to compute balanced accuracy. 

[0040] For the Two-Stage classifier 200, a confusion matrix obtained from a 4-emotion classification exhibited relatively less confusion in the emotion pairs Neutral-Happy and Angry-Fear, as compared to the four other pairs. In addition, thorough observation of feature histogram plots for all four emotions revealed that some features were able to sufficiently discriminate between certain emotions, while not being able to do so for the rest, and vice versa. FIGS. 8A and 8B are examples of a first feature that clearly discriminates between the emotions of anger and fear (FIG. 8A) and second feature that shows a large overlap between these two emotions (FIG. 8B). 

[0041] Recognizing the overlap shown in FIG. 8B, the emotion recognition system employs a model which achieves high classification accuracy across the emotions by performing a classification cascade between different sets of emotions, thereby resulting in the two-stage classifier 200. Referring again to FIG. 3, in this framework, the first stage determines if the emotion detected was a positive one (Class1), i.e. Neutral or Happy, or a negative emotion (Class2), i.e. Anger or Fear. Depending on the result of the first stage, the emotion would then either be classified as Neutral or Happy, or as Anger or Fear by separate classifiers 200 in the second stage. 

[0042] To further improve accuracy, the emotion recognition system employs a feature reduction mechanism. In the preferred embodiment, the feature extractor generates 42 features, consisting of 32 Cepstral, 5 pitch, and 5 amplitude features. However, some of the features do not add any information for the purpose of distinguishing between different emotions or emotion classes. Therefore, features are ranked based on their discriminative capability, with the aim of removing the low ranked ones. Histogram plots for each feature indicate that, for most cases, the distribution within each class could be approximated by a unimodal Gaussian. Referring again to FIGS. 8A-8B, the plots show histograms of two features for Anger-versus-Fear classification, one with high (FIG. 8A) and low (FIG. 8B) discriminative ability, respectively. 

[0043] In order to quantify the discriminative capability of each feature, a parameter M is defined for classes i and j, such that M(i,j) is the percentage of files in class j that occupy values inside the range of values from class i with i.noteq.j. 

[0044] For a feature having values distributed over k classes, there would be a matrix M of size k.times.(k-1), where each row contained the overlap values between a particular class and each of the (k-1) remaining classes. The lesser the overlap a feature offered, the higher was its discriminative capability. Depending on the type of classification to be performed, the appropriate average overlap was calculated. 

[0045] For Anger-versus-Rest classification, the average overlap was calculated as shown in Equation (1). 

Overlap = 1 l j M ( anger , j ) where j .di-elect cons. { neutral , happy , fear } , l = j ( 1 ) ##EQU00001## 

For a Class1-versus-Class2 classification, where Class1 consists of Neutral and Happy, and Class2 consists of Angry and Fear, the overlap was calculated as shown in Equation (2). 

Overlap = 1 k .times. l i j M ( i , j ) where i .di-elect cons. { neutral , happy } , j .di-elect cons. { anger , fear } , k = i , l = j ( 2 ) ##EQU00002## 

[0046] Thus, for a given classification problem, features are first ranked in decreasing order of discriminative ability, and the ones with the worst discriminative power are successively removed, the classification trial is run with a reduced set each time. 

[0047] While the method is conceptually similar to feature selection methods such as Minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevance (mRMR), which makes use of mutual information from a feature set for a target class, it is significantly different in the following ways. 

[0048] First, the focus is on feature removal, not on feature selection. This means that the method of the present invention concentrates on discarding features that do not contribute enough towards classification, rather than finding the set of features that contributes best to classification. Additionally, mutual information is symmetric and averaged over all classes, while Overlap M is asymmetric and specific to a pair of classes, i.e. M(i,j).noteq.M(j,i). Thus, the present invention can find a feature's discriminative power for classification between any set of classes. This mechanism of feature removal reduces bandwidth and increases accuracy of the emotion recognition system. 

[0049] In the preferred embodiment, feature paring is speaker independent. However, in alternate embodiments, feature paring can be based on age, gender, dialect, or accents. Consideration of these variables in the feature removal process has the potential to increase accuracy of the emotion recognition system. 

[0050] The feature removal feature can be implemented as part of the training for each classifier 200. In the preferred embodiment, each classifier 200 is trained separately. For example, in the Two-Stage Hierarchical classifier 200, a first classifier 200 will distinguish between class 1 and class 2 emotions and is trained specifically for making this determination. That is, the classifier 200 will use the best features that discriminate class 1 utterances from class 2 utterances. A second classifier 200 will distinguish between neutral and happy emotions, while the third classifier 200 will distinguish between angry and fear emotions, with the second and third classifiers 200 each being trained separately. 

[0051] FIG. 4 is a flow diagram showing the classifier training method, according to one embodiment. Training can be based on individual speakers, or it can be speaker independent. For example, an emotion recognition system used in a virtual coach for stroke rehabilitation could be speaker independent since many different patients will be using the system. Alternatively, the system could be trained specifically for the patient if the system were their personal system. 

[0052] As shown in step 401, first a SVM model is selected. Next, at step 402, the features are pared based on the discriminative ability. According to the method described above, as part of the discrimination process the features are ordered based on their discriminative ability at step 402A. Next, the least important features are removed at step 402B. At step 403, cross-validation is performed. During step 404, the sigma and complexity values are selected. For example, values of each can be sigma: {1e.sup.-2, 1e.sup.-1, 1, 5, 10} and complexity: {1e.sup.-2, 1e.sup.-1, 2+1e.sup.-1, 5+1e.sup.-1, 1}. For each sigma value and each complexity value: the training and testing indices are prepared at step 405, the kernel is applied to the training data at step 406, the model is tested and trained at step 407, and the confusion matrix is updated at step 408. Next, the accuracy for each confusion matrix is calculated at step 409. At step 410, the best combination is selected and the SVM model is saved. 

[0053] The binary classification has its highest accuracy associated with a unique set of features. The complete set consisted of the mean of the first 16 Cepstral coefficients followed by the standard deviation of those coefficients and the mean, maximum, minimum, standard deviation and range of the fundamental frequency and the amplitude, respectively. Analysis of the best feature set for each classifier suggests two important things. The highest cross-validation accuracy for all emotions except fear emotion was obtained when the least discriminative features were pruned. The One-Against-All classifier for fear vs. rest used all 42 features. Additionally, amplitude features, except the mean value, are not discriminative enough for problems involving neutral and disgust emotions, particularly for One-Against-All classification. 

[0054] The classification accuracy and the associated feature set for different classification problems are summarized in FIG. 9, where a shaded bar indicates that the particular feature was used, while the absence indicates that the feature was pruned. The table shows that, for most of the cases, the best accuracy is achieved when the number of least discriminative features is removed for the LDC dataset. 

[0055] In One-Against-All classification, the average classifier 200 accuracy was found to be 82.07%, while in the two-stage classification framework, the average accuracy was 87.70%. For Anger vs. Fear and Class 1 vs. Class 2 classification tasks, SVM with quadratic kernels gave the best results, whereas RBF kernels performed best for the rest of the trials. Table II shows the accuracy results for One-Against-All classification and those of a prior art system using OAA classification for a six-class recognition task. 

[0056] A comparison of the results for One-Against-All classification with those of a different classification system shows that the method of the present invention achieves higher average accuracy, as shown in Table III. The Banana Oil dataset was used in this trial.

[0057] As one non-limiting example of a system of the present invention, the emotion recognition system is applied in an intelligent system 300 used to facilitate stroke rehabilitation exercises. The virtual coach evaluates the user's exercises and offers corrections for rehabilitation of stroke survivors. The virtual coach for stroke rehabilitation exercises is composed of an imaging device 302 (Microsoft Kinect sensor, for example) for monitoring motion, a machine learning model to evaluate the quality of the exercise, and a user interface 303 comprised of a tablet for the clinician to configure parameters of exercise. A normalized Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was trained to recognize correct and erroneous postures and exercise movements. 

[0058] Coaching feedback examples include encouragement, suggesting taking a rest, suggesting a different exercise, and stopping all together. For example, as shown in FIG. 5, if the user's emotion is classified as angry, the system advises the user to `take a rest`. While the emotion recognition system does not analyze the content of the speech, the intelligent system 300 can include a word spotting feature to further assist adjusting to the user's behavior. As shown in FIG. 5, word spotting can include identification of words such as "OK," "Tired," and "Pain." 

[0059] An interactive dialog can be added to elicit responses from the user, as shown in FIG. 6. Based on these responses, the emotion is gauged by the audio emotion recognizer. The coaching dialog changes depending on performance, user response to questions, and user emotions. FIG. 7A depicts a patient using the virtual coach, while FIG. 7B illustrates the situation when the system recognizes the user emotion as angry, and advises the user to `take a rest`. 

[0060] In addition to a virtual coach, the emotion recognition system can be incorporated into other intelligent systems 300, such as autonomous reactive robots, reactive vehicles, mobile phones, and intelligent rooms. In all of these examples, the intelligent systems 300 will benefit from the emotion recognition system described herein. For intelligent systems 300 where the primary purpose of the device or system is not emotion recognition, such as a mobile phone, a speech trigger can be used to detect the onset of speech or a specific command that initiates the emotion recognition sequence. The speech trigger would save battery life since the emotion recognition system would not be running during periods when it was not being utilized. 

[0061] While the disclosure has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modification can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the embodiments. Thus, it is intended that the present disclosure cover the modifications and variations of this disclosure provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.

Description


CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS 

[0001] This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. .sctn.119(e) of U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 61/958,843 filed on 7 Aug. 2013, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. 

FIELD OF THE INVENTION 

[0002] This invention relates to an apparatus and methods for cell and tissue culture. More specifically, this invention relates to a cell culture apparatus that provides dynamic and reversible control of local substrate elasticity in devices used for in vitro cell and tissue culture. 

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 

[0003] The fabrication of cell culture substrates in 2-D with tunable stiffnesses has been an intensively studied field in mechanobiology. Previous studies have revealed that cell motility, the reorganization of cellular cytoskeleton and stem cell differentiation are influenced by substrate stiffness and compliance. 

[0004] Polymeric substrates which have been used in extracellular substrate stiffness studies include poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) gels, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), polyacrylamide (PA) and hyaluronic acid (HA) based polymer systems. These polymers require the establishment of unique formulations for each gel system, such as tuning the different cross-linker concentrations to vary the stiffness of the gel system. A major disadvantage and limitation of these systems are that the material properties are fixed and not dynamic. As such, spatially dynamic sti less gradients within hydrogels have been formulated to overcome these limitations. For example, hydrogels with differing stiffnesses on the same substrate have been fabricated by mixing different formulations of PA gels. More advanced fabrication techniques have made use of microfluidics to fabricate PA gel gradients. PDMS substrates with stiffness gradients have also been fabricated from patterning. Although substrate stiffness properties can be dynamically controlled spatially in these cases, the limitation of static temporal stiffness in these systems still exists. 

[0005] To overcome the limitation in temporal stiffness experienced by existing polymeric systems, ultra-violet (UV) photomodulatable hydrogels have been used, such as PA, PEG and methacrylated HA. However, these systems still face a limitation as the change in stiffness is not reversible spatially or temporally. The stiffness of the substrates can only soften or stiffen with time. 

[0006] Present methods to fabricate thin-film polymers include the spin coating of PDMS as well as the fabrication of thin PDMS films from silicon wafer molds. Disadvantages to current thin-film fabrication methods are that the direct spin coating or pouring of PDMS into molds would cause the PDMS to stick to the underlying substrate, and the PDMS thin-film is subjected to a large peeling force when the film is removed from the substrate, possibly tearing it. Even if the films are able to be removed, the lateral dimensions of the films are limited to hundreds of microns in length. 

[0007] In addition, current existing methods for fabricating bilayer polymeric substrates suitable for 2-D cell culture include polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) fabrication by depositing polyanions and polycations separately onto a surface and the successive spin coating of polymers on top of one another on a rigid substrate. Such methods do not allow the separation of the individual layers away from the bilayer structure. 

[0008] Of the known apparatus and systems mentioned above, none can be used to induce different cell growth characteristics (i.e. such as morphology, motility, aggregation, differentiation etc.) in a reversible manner such that the induction of different growth characteristics can be dynamically changed and selected. 

[0009] There is therefore a need to provide an apparatus or method that at least partially ameliorates one or more of the disadvantages described above. 

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 

[0010] A cell culture apparatus for culturing cells, the apparatus comprising at least one chamber for containing and growing the cells therein, the chamber being adapted to connect with at least one removable member of a set of removable members, each of the removable members of said set providing a surface for cell adhesion and having a different stiffness relative to other removable members of the set, the stiffness of each removable member of said set being selected to induce cell growth that is different from other removable members within the set. 

[0011] Advantageously, the cell culture apparatus provides a cell culture environment for cells that enables the cells to be exposed to growth surfaces with varying stiffness both spatially and temporally. That is, the cells can be exposed to growth surfaces with different stiffnesses simultaneously or over a period of time. Advantageously, the apparatus is adapted to enable reversible spatial and temporal change in stiffness of the growth surface. That is, the cells may first be exposed to a surface having stiffness A, then subsequently to a surface having stiffness B after a certain period of time, then back to a surface having stiffness A after another period of time. Alternatively, the cells may be exposed to a surface having stiffness A, then a surface having stiffness B, then a surface having stiffness C, over a period of time. Alternatively again, the cells may simultaneously be exposed to growth surfaces having multiple stiffness. Advantageously, due to the way the apparatus is configured, the cells may be exposed to different growth surface stiffnesses without having to be removed from the growth surface. As such, it is possible to monitor the cell property when the cells are exposed to different stiffness growth surfaces without imparting any physical or biochemical stress to the cells that may occur during cell removal from a surface. 

[0012] Advantageously, the apparatus is adapted such that the cells are grown within a chamber which can be connected and disconnected to a removable member. The removable member may be one of a set of removable members that may have a selected stiffness that is different to the stiffness of other removable members in the set. The chamber may comprise a containment layer or a membrane to which the cells may adhere thereon. The containment layer or membrane may have a selected dimension or thickness that may allow the cells to be affected by or sense the environment on the other side of the containment layer or membrane. Advantageously, cells are able to sense the thickness of substrates that they are being seeded on, as has been quantified by traction forces in 3-dimensions. As such, the cells may be affected or sense the stiffness of the substrate to which the surface it is adhered thereon is exposed to. 

[0013] As the chamber can be connected and disconnected from the removable member, changing of the stiffness of the removable member enables the cells that are adhered to the containment layer or membrane to be affected by or sense the stiffness of the removable member through the containment layer or the membrane. As such, by connecting different removable members with a different selected stiffness, it enables the cells to be affected by or to sense the stiffness of the respective removable members, consequently experiencing different growth surface stiffness. 

[0014] Advantageously, this apparatus may be used as a tool to investigate the influence of reversible dynamic stiffness environments on cell morphology, motility, proliferation and differentiation in various cells types. 

[0015] A method for culturing cells in a cell culture apparatus, the method comprising the step of incubating cells while exposed to a set of surfaces for cell adhesion, wherein each surface of the set has a different stiffness to other surfaces within the set, wherein the stiffness of each surface is selected to induce cell growth that is different from other surfaces within the set. 

[0016] Advantageously, the method allows induction of different cell growth characteristics (i.e. such as morphology, motility, aggregation, differentiation etc.) in a reversible manner such that the induction of different growth characteristics can be dynamically changed and selected. 

[0017] A cell culture kit for culturing cells having different growth characteristics, the kit comprising: at least one chamber for containing and growing the cells therein and containing at least one receiving conduit for being coupled to a removable members that contains surface of growing cells thereon; a set of removable members that are configured to couple to receiving conduit of the chamber, each of said removable members having a selected stiffness that is different to other removable members of the set, the stiffness of each member being selected to induce cell growth that is different from other removable members within the set

EXAMPLES 

[0140] Non-limiting examples of the invention will be further described in greater detail by reference to specific Examples, which should not be construed as in any way limiting the scope of the invention. 

Example 1 

The Thin Film Construct 

[0141] Preparation and Characterization of Thin PDMS Membranes 

[0142] By modifying the fabrication process, square thin PDMS membranes with thicknesses from 3 .mu.m down to 100 nm can be fabricated with widths ranging from 100 .mu.m up to 5 mm (FIG. 1). Briefly, SU-8 5 (Micro Chem) was spin-coated onto a silicon wafer. Here, the spin-coating speed and time was optimized to be at 2000 RPM for 30 s respectively. By this step, an even layer of SU-8 5 was obtained, onto which the PDMS membranes were formed. 

[0143] By varying the base/curing agent ratio in the PDMS membranes (Sylgard 184; Dow Corning), the resulting elastic modulus can be modified. For example, Young's modulus values of 500, 750, 1000, and 1600 kPa were obtained using ratios of 25, 20:1, 15:1, and 10:1 silicone elastomer base/curing agent, respectively. 

[0144] In order to obtain PDMS membranes with thicknesses in the order of hundreds of nanometers, the PDMS solution can be diluted with hexane (Fisher Scientific) at PDMS:Hexane ratios of 1:5, 1:10, 1:20, 1:30, 1:60 and 1:90 before being spin-coated on top of the SU-8 5 layer at 6000 RPM for 150 s to produce PDMS membranes with 1540, 740, 410, 315, 195 and 96 nm thicknesses respectively. 

[0145] The silicon wafer construct was baked at 110.degree. C. for 15 min. A thick PDMS square window supporting frame with a height of 3 mm, an outer width of 10 mm and an inner window width of 5 mm was placed onto the PDMS membrane and left to bond at room temperature. To detach the PDMS block with the PDMS membrane bonded to it from the silicon wafer, the silicon wafer construct was placed in an SU-8 developer (Micro Chem) for 1-2 min, and the PDMS block with the PDMS membrane bonded to it was carefully removed and rinsed with ethyl alcohol (95%; PHARMCO-AAPER) and deionized H.sub.2O before being sterilized under the UV hood for 1 hr. 

[0146] By varying the PDMS: Hexane ratio, we were able to vary the thickness of the PDMS membranes from 500 nm all the way down to 100 nm (FIG. 5). The thickness of the PDMS membranes were measured using an AFM tapping mode by placing the membrane on a glass cover slip and scratching the membrane to expose the underlying glass. The difference in topographical height between the membrane surface and the glass coverslip surface is the thickness of the membrane. 

[0147] By using this method of diluting the polymer with a solvent and spin-coating the silicone wafer with a sacrificial layer of SU-8 5, it is possible to fabricate membranes with a thickness in the range of 50 nm to 5 .mu.m also having a large diameter of up to 10 mm. 

[0148] Preparation of Underlying PDMS Gel Substrates 

[0149] Commercially available PDMS, Sylgard 527 gel and Sylgard 184 elastomer (Dow Corning), were mixed to create PDMS substrates with different mechanical properties. Sylgard 527 was prepared by mixing equal weights of part A and B while Sylgard 184 was prepared by mixing a 10:1 ratio of silicone elastomer base/curing agent. Three different ratios of the Sylgard 184: Sylgard 527 were evaluated; 1:0, 1:20 and 1:10. Pure Sylgard 527 and Sylgard 184 polymer mixtures were first created separately as described above before being mixed at the three different ratios and degassed under vacuum to remove any bubbles before curing overnight at 60.degree. C. The stiffnesses of the three polymers, as measured using methods known in the art were 5, 20 and 50 kPa for Sylgard 527: Sylgard 184 ratios of 1:0, 1:20 and 1:10 respectively. 

[0150] To increase the future rate of detachment of the underlying PDMS gel substrate from the PDMS membranes, a sacrificial layer of 5% (w/v) sucrose solution was spin-coated onto the PDMS gel substrates at 3000 RPM for 15 s. The PDMS gel substrate was then baked at 80.degree. C. for 30 min. 

[0151] Other underlying PDMS gel substrates include formulations of PDMS whereby stiffnesses can be changed either by varying the amount of premixed components before mixing to obtain the final polymeric solution or by varying the amount of curing agent added. In one example, the PDMS polymer CY52-276 (Dow Corning) is used. By mixing and varying the amount of CY52-276A and CY52-276B added to the final polymeric solution to be cured, the stiffness of the PDMS gel can be tuned upwards from a Young's Modulus of 1 kPa. 

[0152] FIG. 2 shows a summary of all the components of the containment layer such as a membrane 210 mentioned above. The three components are the thin PDMS membrane construct 211, the support frames 212, and the underlying PDMS gel substrate 213. 

[0153] Cell Seeding 

[0154] To prepare PDMS membranes for cell culture, the surfaces were first sterilized using ethyl alcohol (PHARMCO-AAPER). Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Fisher Scientific) at a 10.times. solution was diluted to 1.times. with deionized H.sub.2O, filtered, and used as a buffer solution. The PDMS substrates were coated with fibronectin (10 mg/mL, PBS; BD Biosciences) for 60 min. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (National Institutes of Health) were washed once with PBS and then exposed to trypsin-ethylenediamine-tetraacetate (0.05%; Invitrogen) for 5 min to dissociate them from the tissue culture plates. The cells were then seeded onto the PDMS membranes and cultured at 37.degree. C. and 5% carbon dioxide in growth media consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, glutamine (0.3 mg/mL), streptomycin (100 mg/mL), penicillin (100 U/mL), and 20 mM n-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-n'-2-ethanesulfonic acid at a pH of 7.4. Cells were incubated for 24 h to allow them to attach and spread. 

[0155] Modulation of Stiffness 

[0156] The PDMS membranes with cells seeded on them were transplanted between PA gels with differing stiffnesses to simulate a dynamic substrate stiffness environment (FIG. 3). When transplanting, deionized H.sub.2O was added in-between the thin-film and the underlying PDMS substrate to reduce adhesion forces between the two layers before they are separated. The temporal stiffening of the cell environment was simulated by transplanting the PDMS membranes from a softer to a stiffer underlying PA substrate and vice versa. The spatial modulation of the substrate stiffness environment was obtained by shifting an underlying hard/soft PA gel substrate interface underneath the PDMS membrane to simulate a spatially changing stiffness environment for the cells on the PDMS membrane. 

[0157] Specifically, a 1.5 .mu.m thick PDMS thin membrane was first attached to a PDMS upright frame having a 10 mm by 10 mm window and a height of 10 mm. The frame was placed in a UV hood for 1 hr to sterilize it. The frame was then placed onto a removable PDMS underlying substrate with a stiffness of 1 kPa in a 60 mm petri dish. The PDMS underlying substrate was pre-coated with 5% sucrose solution using spin-coating. Next, the thin PDMS membrane was coated with fibronectin (10 mg/mL in PBS) for 60 min. 0.5 ml of an NIH 3T3 cell suspension at a density of 10,000 cells/mL were then seeded onto the PDMS membranes and cultured at 37.degree. C. and in an atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide in growth media consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, glutamine (0.3 mg/mL), streptomycin (100 mg/mL), penicillin (100 U/mL), and 20 mM n-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-n0-2-ethanesulfonic acid at a pH of 7.4. Cells were incubated for 24 h to allow them to attach and spread. The cell morphology was then visualized under a microscope, before deionized H.sub.2O was added in between the thin PDMS membrane and the underlying PDMS substrate, and the PDMS upright frame attached to the thin membrane was gently detached from the underlying 1 kPa PDMS substrate. The upright frame with the cells was then placed onto a separate removable 40 kPa PDMS substrate coated with a 5% sucrose layer in a 60 mm petri dish and incubated for 6 hrs. The cell morphologies were then visualized under a microscope. 

Example 2 

High-Throughput Cell Culture Studies 

[0158] The description of the above mentioned thin-film construct for cell culture studies can be further expanded to build a high-throughput cell-culture plate assay 410, as shown in FIG. 4. The thin-film 411 is first fabricated as per the previous description, and the support structure used is a bottomless multi-well cell culture plate 412. As such, the bottom of each well would be a thin-film, which is separate from other wells of the plate, allowing for cells in each of the wells to be subjected later to different stiffness conditions. The PDMS gel substrate 413 described previously is patterned onto a large glass coverslip 414, such that the patterns correspond to the shape of the wells in the corresponding multi-well plate 412. The stiffness of the PDMS gel substrate in each circular pattern in 413 can be varied individually. The multi-well component consisting of 411 and 412 can then be placed on top of 413, completing the high-throughput embodiment of the thin-film construct. 

Example 3 

Methods for Validation of the Thin-Film Construct 

[0159] Fluorescent Staining and Microscope Visualization 

[0160] To visualize the cytoskeletal structure of the cells using fluorescent immunostaining, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and treated with 0.1% Triton-X, followed by staining with 6 mM phalloidin-tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate (Sigma-Aldrich) and DAPI (40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride; 2 mg in 1 mL PBS; Invitrogen), which labeled the actin filaments and the nucleus, respectively. After incubating the cells with phalloidin and DAPI, they were mounted on glass coverslips with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech). By using an inverted fluorescent microscope (Axiovert 200; Carl Zeiss) with a 63.times. (1.4 NA) objective, the actin filaments and nucleus of the NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were imaged. Cell sizes and migration speeds were obtained using a 20.times. (0.3 NA) objective fitted with a temperature control incubator under phase contrast. 

[0161] Physical Characterization of Stiffness and Thickness 

[0162] The stiffness of the PDMS gels and the PDMS membrane-PDMS gel, alone or in combination, were determined using a Hertz indentation method through FEA simulations carried out using Autodesk (Autodesk, Inc.). The thicknesses of the PDMS membranes were determined using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM, Dimension 3000 SPM; Digital Instruments) through surface scanning microscopy. 

[0163] Data Analysis 

[0164] Cell areas were measured using a program written in MATLAB (The MathWorks). FEA simulations were carried out using Autodesk (Autodesk, Inc.) and the results were analysed in MATLAB. 

Example 4 

Delamination 

[0165] Delamination of the thin PDMS membrane from the underlying PDMS substrate was not observed to occur during cell culture. 

[0166] For an elastic thin film on a compliant substrate, two types of buckling modes can occur due to Compressive stress in the film, a (FIG. 6A). The first is a buckling of the film without delamination (wrinkling) as shown in FIG. 6A. The critical stress for wrinkling is: 

.sigma. w = E _ f 4 ( 3 E _ s E _ f ) 2 / 3 ( 1 ) ##EQU00001## 

[0167] The plane-strain moduli of the film and substrate are .sub.f and .sub.s respectively. When .sigma.>.sigma..sub.w, the buckling of the film causes wrinkles to form throughout the surface of the film. 

[0168] The second mode of buckling for elastic thin films on compliant substrates is the buckling of the film with delamination (buckling-delamination) as shown in FIG. 4A. The critical stress for the buckling of a independent thin film is: 

.sigma. B 0 = .pi. 2 12 ( h b ) 2 E _ f ( 2 ) ##EQU00002## 

[0169] The half width of the delamination and thickness of the film are b and h respectively. On compliant substrates, the critical stress for buckling-delamination of a film on a compliant substrate, .sigma..sub.B, can be lower than that of the buckling of a free film .sigma..sub.B0, depending on how compliant the substrate is. An implicit expression of .sigma..sub.B is: 

.sigma. B 0 .sigma. B tan ( .pi. .sigma. B .sigma. B 0 ) = .pi. h 12 b ( a 12 2 b h + a 11 - a 22 ) ( 3 ) ##EQU00003## 

[0170] Where a.sub.11, a.sub.12 and a.sub.22 are the compliance coefficients of the film-substrate system which are determined numerically through FEA. Equation (3) is then solved semi-analytically using the Newton-Raphson method for .sigma..sub.B, using .sigma..sub.B0 as a first approximation. 

[0171] In FIG. 6B, normalized stresses critical stress, .sigma./ .sub.f, is plotted against the stiffness ratio .sub.s/ .sub.f. The plots for wrinkling and buckling delamination for systems with stiffness ratio .sub.s/ .sub.f are shown. The critical wrinkling stress (red line) and buckling, stresses associated with b/h ratios of 5, 60 and 100 are plotted. In the present system, a Sylgard 184 PDMS membrane with a young's modulus of E.sub.s=1800 kPa was used for all the different film-substrate configurations. For the substrate, the properties of Sylgard 527 PDMS was varied to give three different young's modulus values of E.sub.f=5, 20 and 50 kPa. As such, the region of interest (pink area) in the present system as shown in FIG. 1b is then bounded by the dotted vertical lines E.sub.s.sup.min=5 kPa and E.sub.s.sup.max=50 kPa and the dotted horizontal line .sigma..sub.traction/ .sub.f, the known normalized maximum traction force exerted by cells. It can be seen that critical buckling stresses associated with b/h ratios of 60 and above can be experienced in the present system. In order to prevent buckling-delamination from occurring in the present system, a safety factor of 2.5 for the film-substrate system is specified, which translates to satisfying a requirement of b/h.ltoreq.24. 

Example 5 

Optimization of PDMS Thin Membrane Thickness 

[0172] Hertz indentation simulations for measuring stiffness were carried out to determine if there were any differences in stiffnesses measured through a PDMS gel as compared to the measured stiffnesses of the underlying PDMS gel alone. These differences between the two cases were quantified as a percentage difference in stiffness between the case where the membrane and the gel are measured together and the case where the gel is measured directly. FIGS. 7, A and B show the FEA simulations of a steel ball before and after indentation into the underlying substrate in Autodesk Inventor. 

[0173] To fulfill a requirement of b/h.ltoreq.24 for the present system, b is taken to be bounded and fixed by the maximum radius that a cell can spread on a 2-D substrate (25), which is taken to be 36 Therefore, the only parameter which can be tuned in the present system to satisfy the requirement of b/h.ltoreq.24 is by increasing h. However, by increasing h, the percentage difference in stiffness of the present film-substrate system compared to the stiffness of the substrate (measured by Hertz indentation) increases, as shown in FIG. 7. A a film thickness of h=1.5 .mu.m was picked, thus settling for a maximum percentage difference in stiffness of approximately 6% for the present experiments. 

[0174] Having chosen all the appropriate film and substrate parameters, which are film material and thickness, substrate material and range of stiffnesses, the system is configured so not to experience cell traction-induced wrinkling or buckling-delamination, even when transferring the thin film from one underlying substrate to another. 

Example 6 

Stiffnesses of Substrate and Cell Spread Area 

[0175] Stiffnesses of substrate and cell spread area using thin-membrane transplantation method were found to be comparable to those seeded directly on the underlying substrate. 

[0176] FIG. 8 compares NIH 3T3 cell characteristics seeded directly on 5, 20 and 50 kPa PDMS substrates with cells seeded on the thin film-PDMS substrate construct. FIG. 8A shows a graph of cell area versus stiffness of the underlying substrate. The control cases when cells were seeded directly on the PDMS substrates for 6 hr are shown by the blue bars. The cell spread area of cells in control cases were compared to those of cells seeded on the thin PDMS films, which were placed on substrates of different stiffnesses for 6 hr (denoted by yellow bars), and those of cells seeded on thin PDMS films which were initially placed on PDMS substrates for 6 hr, then transferred to another substrate with a different stiffness than the initial PDMS substrate after 6 hr (denoted by both red and green bars). A student's t-test was conducted on the datasets, using the cell spread area of cells seeded directly on the 5, 20 and 50 kPa PDMS substrates as controls and the p-values of the test are denoted in FIG. 8A. The cell spread area of cells seeded on the thin PDMS films placed on top of underlying PDMS substrates show no significant difference, based on the p-values obtained from the student's t-test at a 90% confidence level (p<0.1), when compared to the cell spread area of cells which were seeded directly on top of the PDMS substrates. 

[0177] When the cells seeded on top of PDMS films are transferred from one PDMS substrate to another with a different stiffness compared to the original, the cell spread area changes and show no significant difference to those seeded directly on the PDMS substrates based on the student's t-test at a 90% confidence level. 

[0178] Cell spread area of cells seeded on the thin membranes and stuck on top of PDMS gels show no significant differences from those seeded directly on top of PDMS substrates. Even when the films are transplanted from one PDMS substrate to another with different stiffness, the cell spread area changes and show no significant different to those seeded directly on the PDMS substrates. This shows that the membrane overlaid on the PDMS substrate successfully mimics the cell stiffness environment of the PDMS substrate located below the thin PDMS film. 

[0179] It is noted that the p-values of the cell spread area data groups which were compared to the cell spread area of cells seeded directly on 5 kPa PDMS substrates where on average lower than the p-values of the cell spread area data groups which were compared to the cell spread area of cells seeded directly on 20 and 50 kPa PDMS substrates respectively, as shown in FIG. 8A. This means that for cells seeded on the thin PDMS films which were placed on the 50 kPa underlying PDMS substrates, their cell spread area more closely resembled those of cells seeded directly on the 50 kPa PDMS substrates. A reason for this could be that the difference in stiffness of the membrane overlaid on the PDMS substrate (for thin PDMS films on underlying PDMS substrates) as compared to the stiffness of the underlying PDMS substrates were lower for 50 kPa PDMS substrates than for 5 kPa PDMS substrates, as shown previously in FIG. 7C. Since cell spread area is known to increase with substrate stiffness, this could explain why cells seeded on the thin PDMS films which were placed on the 50 kPa underlying PDMS substrates had cell spread areas more closely resembled those of cells seeded directly on the 50 kPa PDMS substrates as compared to the 20 and 5 kPa PDMS substrates. 

[0180] The F-actin structures of cells stained with Alexa-Phallodin for cells seeded on thin PDMS membrane-PDMS substrate constructs compared to cells seeded directly on 3 PDMS substrates with differing stiffnesses (1, 20 and 50 kPa) are shown in FIG. 8B. Stress fibers become more prominent in both cases where the stiffness of the underlying substrates are increased, further demonstrating that the cells can sense the stiffness of their underlying substrate layer below the PDMS membrane. 

[0181] The present invention has been described in accordance with several examples, which are intended to be illustrative in all aspects rather than restrictive. Thus, the present invention is capable of many variations in detailed implementation, which may be derived from the description contained herein by a person of ordinary skill in the art. 

APPLICATIONS 

[0182] The apparatus and method may be used to investigate the influence of reversible dynamic stiffness environments on cell morphology, motility, proliferation and differentiation in various cells types. 

[0183] It will be apparent that various other modifications and adaptations of the invention will be apparent to the person skilled in the art after reading the foregoing disclosure without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention and it is intended that all such modifications and adaptations come within the scope of the appended claims.

Description


CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION 

[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/076,385 filed Nov. 6, 2014, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. 

FIELD 

[0003] The disclosure pertains to systems and methods for transdermal drug delivery, and, in particular, to systems and methods for making and using dissolvable microneedle arrays. 

BACKGROUND 

[0004] The remarkable physical barrier function of the skin poses a significant challenge to transdermal drug delivery. To address this challenge, a variety of microneedle-array based drug delivery devices have been developed. For example, one conventional method employs solid or hollow microneedles arrays with no active component. Such microneedle arrays can pre-condition the skin by piercing the stratum corneum and the upper layer of epidermis to enhance percutaneous drug penetration prior to topical application of a biologic-carrier or a traditional patch. This method has been shown to significantly increase the skin's permeability; however, this method provides only limited ability to control the dosage and quantity of delivered drugs or vaccine. 

[0005] Conventional methods using solid microneedles that are surface-coated or hollow microneedles attached to a reservoir of biologics have significant limitations, including limitations on drug and dosage combinations and, in some cases, complex fabrication procedures and specialized application settings. Although some solid microneedle arrays that are biodegradable and dissolvable have been developed, the use of these systems has been limited by fabrication processes that are limited in the active components that can be embedded into the array in an effective and efficient manner. 

[0006] Accordingly, although transdermal delivery of biologics using microneedle-array based devices offers attractive theoretical advantages over prevailing oral and needle-based drug delivery methods, considerable practical limitations exist in the design and fabrication associated with microneedle arrays constructed using conventional processes. 

SUMMARY 

[0007] The systems and methods disclosed herein include cutaneous delivery platforms based on dissolvable microneedle arrays that can provide efficient, precise, and reproducible delivery of biologically active molecules to human skin. The microneedle array delivery platforms can be used to deliver a broad range of bioactive components to a patient, including chemotherapeutic agents as disclosed herein for cancer therapy applications. 

[0008] The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages of the disclosed embodiments will become more apparent from the following detailed description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.

[0059] The following description is exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the disclosed embodiments in any way. Various changes to the described embodiment may be made in the function and arrangement of the elements described herein without departing from the scope of the disclosure. 

[0060] As used in this application and in the claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include the plural forms unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Additionally, the term "includes" means "comprises." As used herein, the terms "biologic," "active component," "bioactive component," "bioactive material," or "cargo" refer to pharmaceutically active agents, such as analgesic agents, anesthetic agents, anti-asthmatic agents, antibiotics, anti-depressant agents, anti-diabetic agents, anti-fungal agents, anti-hypertensive agents, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-neoplastic agents, anxiolytic agents, enzymatically active agents, nucleic acid constructs, immunostimulating agents, immunosuppressive agents, vaccines, and the like. The bioactive material can comprise dissoluble materials, insoluble but dispersible materials, natural or formulated macro, micro and nano particulates, and/or mixtures of two or more of dissoluble, dispersible insoluble materials and natural and/or formulated macro, micro and nano particulates. 

[0061] As used herein, the term "chemotherapeutic agent" means any chemical agent with therapeutic usefulness in the treatment of diseases characterized by abnormal cell growth. Such diseases include tumors, neoplasms, and cancer. Chemotherapeutic agents include those known by those skilled in the art for treating a tumor, such as melanoma, including doxorubicin. Chemotherapeutic agents also include immunostimulant agents (specific and non-specific) known by those skilled in the art to stimulate the immune system to reject and destroy tumors, such as Poly(I:C) and Poly-ICLC. 

[0062] In one example, a chemotherapeutic agent is administered to a subject to prevent or treat skin cancer. "Skin cancer," as used herein, refers to a malignant growth on the skin which can have many causes. Skin cancer generally develops in the epidermis (the outermost layer of skin), so a tumor is usually clearly visible. Skin cancer includes both melanoma and nonmelanoma types of cancer. Melanoma (also known as malignant melanoma or cutaneous melanoma) is a cancer that begins in the melanocytes. Because most melanoma cells still produce melanin, melanoma tumors are usually brown or black. Nonmelanoma skin cancers include all skin cancers except malignant melanoma. Thus, for example, chemotherapeutic agents for melanoma include agents that prevent or inhibit development or metastasis of melanoma. 

[0063] An amount of agent that is sufficient to generate a desired response, such as reducing or inhibiting one or more signs or symptoms associated with a condition or disease. When administered to a subject, a dosage will generally be used that will achieve target tissue concentrations. In some examples, an "effective amount" is one that treats one or more symptoms and/or underlying causes of any of a disorder or disease. In some examples, an "effective amount" is a therapeutically effective amount in which the agent alone or with an additional therapeutic agent(s), induces the desired response such as to prevent advancement, delay progression, or to cause regression of a skin cancer. 

[0064] As used herein, the term "pre-formed" means that a structure or element is made, constructed, and/or formed into a particular shape or configuration prior to use. Accordingly, the shape or configuration of a pre-formed microneedle array is the shape or configuration of that microneedle array prior to insertion of one or more of the microneedles of the microneedle array into the patient. 

[0065] Although the operations of exemplary embodiments of the disclosed method may be described in a particular, sequential order for convenient presentation, it should be understood that disclosed embodiments can encompass an order of operations other than the particular, sequential order disclosed. For example, operations described sequentially may in some cases be rearranged or performed concurrently. Further, descriptions and disclosures provided in association with one particular embodiment are not limited to that embodiment, and may be applied to any embodiment disclosed. 

[0066] Moreover, for the sake of simplicity, the attached figures may not show the various ways (readily discernable, based on this disclosure, by one of ordinary skill in the art) in which the disclosed system, method, and apparatus can be used in combination with other systems, methods, and apparatuses. Additionally, the description sometimes uses terms such as "produce" and "provide" to describe the disclosed method. These terms are high-level abstractions of the actual operations that can be performed. The actual operations that correspond to these terms can vary depending on the particular implementation and are, based on this disclosure, readily discernible by one of ordinary skill in the art. 

[0067] Tip-Loaded Microneedle Arrays 

[0068] Dissolvable microneedle arrays enable efficient and safe drug and vaccine delivery to the skin and mucosal surfaces. However, inefficient drug delivery can result from the homogenous nature of conventional microneedle array fabrication. Although the drugs or other cargo that is to be delivered to the patient are generally incorporated into the entire microneedle array matrix, in practice only the microneedles enter the skin and therefore, only cargo contained in the volume of the individual needles is deliverable. Accordingly, the vast majority of the drugs or other cargo that is localized in the non-needle components (e.g., the supporting structure of the array) is never delivered to the patient and is generally discarded as waste. 

[0069] FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate exemplary dimensions of microneedles and microneedle arrays. Based on the illustrative sizes shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, a microneedle array that comprises an active component homogenously distributed throughout the array exhibits active component waste of greater than 40 percent. For example, if the entire area of the array is 61 mm.sup.2 and the microneedle array area is 36 mm.sup.2, then the percent utilization of the active component is less than 60 percent. Although the dimensions reflected in FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate a particular size array and shape of microneedles, it should be understood that similar waste is present in any other size microneedle array in which the active component is homogenously distributed throughout the array, regardless of the size of the array or the shape of the microneedles involved. 

[0070] The systems and methods described herein provide novel microneedle array fabrication technology that utilizes a fully-dissolvable microneedle array substrate and unique microneedle geometries that enable effective delivery of a broad range of active components, including a broad range of protein and/or small molecule medicines and vaccines. 

[0071] As described in more detail herein, in some embodiments, this technology can also uniquely enable the simultaneous co-delivery of multiple chemically distinct agents for polyfunctional drug delivery. Examples of the utility of these devices include, for example, (1) simultaneous delivery of multiple antigens and adjuvants to generate a polyvalent immune response relevant to infectious disease prevention and cancer therapy, (2) co-delivery of chemotherapeutic agents, immune stimulators, adjuvants, and antigens to enable simultaneous adjunct tumor therapies, and (3) localized skin delivery of multiple therapeutic agents without systemic exposure for the treatment of a wide variety of skin diseases. 

[0072] In some embodiments, the systems and method disclosed herein relate to a novel fabrication technology that enables various active components to be incorporated into the needle tips. Thus, by localizing the active components in this manner, the remainder of the microneedle array volume can be prepared using less expensive matrix material that is non-active and generally regarded as safe. The net result is greatly improved efficiency of drug delivery based on (1) reduced waste of non-deliverable active components incorporated into the non-needle portions of the microneedle array, and (2) higher drug concentration in the skin penetrating needle tips. This technological advance results in dramatically improved economic feasibility proportional to the cost of drug cargo, and increased effective cargo delivery capacity per needle of these novel microneedle arrays. 

[0073] FIGS. 3A, 3B, 4A, and 4B illustrate various embodiments of microneedle arrays wherein the active component is concentrated in the microneedle tips of the respective arrays. Thus, in contrast to conventional microneedle arrays, the active component is not present at even concentration throughout the microneedle array since there is little or no active component present in the supporting base structure. In addition, in some embodiments (as shown, for example, in FIGS. 3A, 3B, 4A, and 4B), not only is there little or no active component in the supporting structures, the location of the active component is concentrated in the upper half of the individual microneedles in the array. 

[0074] FIGS. 5A and 5B illustrate exemplary images of microneedles of a microneedle array that contains active component concentrated in the upper half of the individual microneedles. The active component is illustrated as fluorescent particles that are concentrated in the tip of the microneedle, with the tip being defined by an area of the microneedle that extends from a base portion in a narrowing and/or tapered manner The base portion, in turn, extends from the supporting structure of the array. 

[0075] FIGS. 6A and 6B illustrate additional exemplary images of microneedles of microneedle arrays that contain active components concentrated in the upper half of the individual microneedles. In FIG. 6A, the active component, which is concentrated in the tip of the microneedles, is BSA-FITC. In FIG. 6B, the active component, which is also concentrated in the tip of the microneedles, is OVA-FITC. 

[0076] As noted above, in some embodiments, individual microneedles can comprise active components only in the upper half of the microneedle. In other embodiments, individual microneedles can comprise active components only in the tips or in a narrowing portion near the tip of the microneedle. In still other embodiments, individual needles can comprise active components throughout the entire microneedle portion that extends from the supporting structure. 

[0077] The following embodiments describe various exemplary methods for fabricating microneedle arrays with one or more active component concentrated in the upper halves and/or tips of microneedles in respective microneedle arrays. 

[0078] Microneedle Arrays Fabricated by Sequential Micro-Molding and Spin-Drying Methods 

[0079] The following steps describe an exemplary method of fabricating microneedle arrays using sequential micro-molding and spin-drying. Active components/cargo can be prepared at a desired useful concentration in a compatible solvent. As described herein, the solvents of the active component(s) can be cargo specific and can comprise a broad range of liquids, including for example, water, organic polar, and/or apolar liquids. Examples of active components are discussed in more detail below and various information about those active components, including tested and maximum loading capacity of various microneedle arrays are also discussed in more detail below. 

[0080] If desired, multiple loading cycles can be performed to achieve higher active cargo loads as necessary for specific applications. In addition, multiple active cargos can be loaded in a single loading cycle as a complex solution, or as single solutions in multiple cycles (e.g., repeating the loading cycle described below) as per specific cargo-compatibility requirements of individual cargos. Also, particulate cargos (including those with nano- and micro- sized geometries) can be prepared as suspensions at the desired particle number/volume density. 

EXAMPLE 1 

[0081] a) As described in more detail below in the micromilling embodiments, an active cargo's working stock solution/suspension can be applied to the surface of microneedle array production molds at, for example, about 40 .mu.l per cm.sup.2 surface area. 

[0082] b) The microneedle array production molds with active cargo(s) can be centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 10 minutes to fill the microneedle array production molds needles with the working cargo stock. 

[0083] c) The excess cargo solution/suspension can be removed and the surface of the microneedle array production molds, washed with 100 .mu.l phosphate buffer saline (PBS) per cm.sup.2 mold-surface area, or with the solvent used for the preparation of the active cargo's working stock. 

[0084] d) The microneedle array production molds containing the active cargo stock solution/suspension in the needle's cavity can be spin-dried at 3500 rpm for 30 minutes at the required temperature with continues purging gas flow through the centrifuge at 0-50 L/min to facilitate concentration of the drying active cargo(s) in the needle-tips. The purging gas can be introduced into the centrifuge chamber through tubular inlets. Moisture content can be reduced using a dehumidifier tempered to the required temperature with recirculation into the centrifuge chamber. The purging gas can be air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide or another inert or active gas as required for specific cargo(s). The flow rate is measured by flow-meters and controlled by a circulating pump device. 

[0085] e) 100 .mu.l 20% CMC90 hydrogel in H2O can be added to the surface microneedle array production molds' per cm.sup.2 microneedle array production molds-area to load the structural component of the microneedle array device. 

[0086] f) The microneedle array production molds can be centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 10 min at the required temperature without purging gas exchange in the centrifuge chamber to fill up the microneedle array production molds needle cavities with the CMC90 hydrogel. This can be followed by a 30 min incubation period to enable rehydration of the active cargo(s) previously deposited in the microneedle array tips. 

[0087] g) The microneedle array production molds can centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 3 hours or longer at the required temperature with 0-50 L/min constant purging gas flow through the centrifuge chamber to spin-dry the MNA devices to less than 5% moisture content. 

[0088] h) The dried microneedle array devices can then be separated from the microneedle array production molds for storage under the desired conditions. In some embodiments, CMC90 based devices can be storable between about 50.degree. C. to -86.degree. C. 

[0089] Examples of fabricated tip-loaded active cargo carrying microneedle arrays can be seen in FIGS. 3A-6B. 

[0090] Micromilled Master Molds and Spin-Molded Microneedle Arrays 

[0091] In the following embodiments, micromilling steps are preformed to create microneedle arrays of various specifications. It should be understood, however, that the following embodiments describe certain details of microneedle array fabrication that can be applicable to processes of microneedle array fabrication that do not involve micromilling steps, including the process described above in the previous example. 

[0092] In the following embodiments, apparatuses and methods are described for fabricating dissolvable microneedle arrays using master molds formed by micromilling techniques. For example, microneedle arrays can be fabricated based on a mastermold (positive) to production mold (negative) to array (positive) methodology. Micromilling technology can be used to generate various micro-scale geometries on virtually any type of material, including metal, polymer, and ceramic parts. Micromilled mastermolds of various shapes and configurations can be effectively used to generate multiple identical female production molds. The female production molds can then be used to microcast various microneedle arrays. 

[0093] FIG. 7 illustrates an example of a precision-micromilling system that can be used for fabricating a microneedle mastermold. Mechanical micromilling uses micro-scale (for example, as small as 10 .mu.m milling tools within precision computer controlled miniature machine-tool platforms. The system can include a microscope to view the surface of the workpiece that is being cut by the micro-tool. The micro-tool can be rotated at ultra-high speeds (200,000 rpm) to cut the workpiece to create the desired shapes. As noted above, the micromilling process can be used to create complex geometric features with many kinds of material. Various types of tooling can be used in the micromilling process, including, for example, carbide micro-tools. In a preferred embodiment, however, diamond tools can be used to fabricate the microneedle arrays on the master mold. Diamond tooling can be preferable over other types of tooling because it is harder than conventional materials, such as carbide, and can provide cleaner cuts on the surface of the workpiece. 

[0094] Mastermolds can be micromilled from various materials, including, for example, Cirlex.RTM. (DuPont, Kapton.RTM. polyimide), which is the mastermold material described in the exemplary embodiment. Mastermolds can be used to fabricate flexible production molds from a suitable material, such as SYLGARD.RTM. 184 (Dow Corning), which is the production material described in the exemplary embodiment below. The mastermold is desirably formed of a material that is capable of being reused so that a single mastermold can be repeatedly used to fabricate a large number of production molds. Similarly each production mold is desirably able to fabricate multiple microneedle arrays. 

[0095] Mastermolds can be created relatively quickly using micromilling technology. For example, a mastermold that comprises a 10 mm .times.10 mm array with 100 microneedles can take less than a couple of hours and, in some embodiments, less than about 30 minutes to micromill Thus, a short ramp-up time enables rapid fabrication of different geometries, which permits the rapid development of microneedle arrays and also facilitates the experimentation and study of various microneedle parameters. 

[0096] The mastermold material preferably is able to be cleanly separated from the production mold material and preferably is able to withstand any heighted curing temperatures that may be necessary to cure the production mold material. For example, in an illustrated embodiment, the silicone-based compound SYLGARD.RTM. 184 (Dow Corning) is the production mold material and that material generally requires a curing temperature of about 80-90 degrees Celsius. 

[0097] Mastermolds can be created in various sizes. For example, in an exemplary embodiment, a mastermold was created on 1.8 mm thick Cirlex.RTM. (DuPont, Kapton.RTM. polyimide) and 5.0 mm thick acrylic sheets. Each sheet can be flattened first by micromilling tools, and the location where the microneedles are to be created can be raised from the rest of the surface. Micro-tools can be used in conjunction with a numerically controlled micromilling machine (FIG. 1) to create the microneedle features (e.g., as defined by the mastermold). In that manner, the micromilling process can provide full control of the dimensions, sharpness, and spatial distribution of the microneedles. 

[0098] FIG. 8 is an image from a scanning electron microscope (SEM) showing the structure of a micromilled mastermold with a plurality of pyramidal needles. As shown in FIG. 8, a circular groove can be formed around the microneedle array of the mastermold to produce an annular (for example, circular) wall section in the production mold. The circular wall section of the production mold can facilitate the spincasting processes discussed below. Although the wall sections illustrated in FIG. 9 and the respective mastermold structure shown in FIG. 8 is circular, it should be understood that wall sections or containment means of other geometries can be provided. For example, depending on what shape is desired for the microneedle array device, the containment means can be formed in a variety of shapes including, for example, square, rectangular, trapezoidal, polygonal, or various irregular shapes. 

[0099] As discussed above, the production molds can be made from SYLGARD.RTM. 184 (Dow Corning), which is a two component clear curable silicone elastomer that can be mixed at a 10:1 SYLGARD.RTM. to curing agent ratio. The mixture can be degassed for about 10 minutes and poured over the mastermold to form an approximately 8 mm layer, subsequently degassed again for about 30 minutes and cured at 85.degree. C. for 45 minutes. After cooling down to room temperature, the mastermold can be separated from the cured silicone, and the silicone production mold trimmed to the edge of the circular wall section that surrounds the array (FIG. 9.). From a single mastermold, a large number of production molds (e.g., 100 or more) can be produced with very little, if any, apparent deterioration of the Cirlex.RTM. or acrylic mastermolds. 

[0100] FIG. 9 is an SEM image of a pyramidal production mold created as described above. FIG. 10 illustrates an enlarged segment of the production mold with a pyramidal needle molding well in the center of the image. The molding well is configured to receive a base material (and any components added to the base material) to form microneedles with an external shape defined by the molding well. 

[0101] To construct the microneedle arrays, a base material can be used to form portions of each microneedle that have bioactive components and portions that do not. As discussed above, each microneedle can comprise bioactive components only in the microneedles, or in some embodiments, only in the upper half of the microneedles, or in other embodiments, only in a portion of the microneedle that tapers near the tip. Thus, to control the delivery of the bioactive component(s) and to control the cost of the microneedle arrays, each microneedle preferably has a portion with a bioactive component and a portion without a bioactive component. In the embodiments described herein, the portion without the bioactive component includes the supporting structure of the microneedle array and, in some embodiments, a base portion (e.g., a lower half) of each microneedle in the array. 

[0102] Various materials can be used as the base material for the microneedle arrays. The structural substrates of biodegradable solid microneedles most commonly include poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) or carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) based formulations; however, other bases can be used. 

[0103] CMC is generally preferable to PLGA as the base material of the microneedle arrays described herein. The PLGA based devices can limit drug delivery and vaccine applications due to the relatively high temperature (e.g., 135 degrees Celsius or higher) and vacuum required for fabrication. In contrast, a CMC-based matrix can be formed at room temperature in a simple spin-casting and drying process, making CMC-microneedle arrays more desirable for incorporation of sensitive biologics, peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, and other various bioactive components. 

[0104] CMC-hydrogel can be prepared from low viscosity sodium salt of CMC with or without active components (as described below) in sterile dH.sub.2O. In the exemplary embodiment, CMC can be mixed with sterile distilled water (dH.sub.2O) and with the active components to achieve about 25 wt % CMC concentration. The resulting mixture can be stirred to homogeneity and equilibrated at about 4 degrees Celsius for 24 hours. During this period, the CMC and any other components can be hydrated and a hydrogel can be formed. The hydrogel can be degassed in a vacuum for about an hour and centrifuged at about 20,000 g for an hour to remove residual micro-sized air bubbles that might interfere with a spincasting/drying process of the CMC-microneedle arrays. The dry matter content of the hydrogel can be tested by drying a fraction (10 g) of it at 85 degrees Celsius for about 72 hours. The ready-to-use CMC-hydrogel is desirably stored at about 4 degrees Celsius until use. 

[0105] Active components can be incorporated in a hydrogel of CMC at a relatively high (20-30%) CMC-dry biologics weight ratio before the spin-casting process. Arrays can be spin-cast at room temperature, making the process compatible with the functional stability of a structurally broad range of bioactive components. Since the master and production molds can be reusable for a large number of fabrication cycles, the fabrication costs can be greatly reduced. The resulting dehydrated CMC-microneedle arrays are generally stable at room temperature or slightly lower temperatures (such as about 4 degrees Celsius), and preserve the activity of the incorporated biologics, facilitating easy, low cost storage and distribution. 

[0106] In an exemplary embodiment, the surface of the production molds can be covered with about 50 .mu.l (for molds with 11 mm diameter) of CMC-hydrogel and spin-casted by centrifugation at 2,500 g for about 5 minutes. After the initial CMC-hydrogel layer, another 50 .mu.l CMC-hydrogel can be layered over the mold and centrifuged for about 4 hours at 2,500 g. At the end of a drying process, the CMC-microneedle arrays can be separated from the molds, trimmed off from excess material at the edges, collected and stored at about 4 degrees Celsuis. The production molds can be cleaned and reused for further casting of microneedle arrays. 

[0107] In some embodiments, CMC-solids can be formed with layers that do not contain active components and layers that contain active components. FIGS. 11A-D illustrate CMC-solids with different shapes (FIGS. 11A and 11B) and embedded active cargos on an upper layer which becomes, after micromilling, the portions of the microneedle with the active components. FIG. 11C illustrates micron sized fluorescent particles layered on a surface of a non-active component containing layer and FIG. 11D illustrates toluidine blue examples layered on a surface of a non-active component containing layer. 

[0108] FIGS. 12A and 12B also illustrate CMC-solids with different shapes, with FIG. 12B showing a square shape and FIG. 12B showing a rectangular shape. Both CMC solids can be milled to dimensions for further processing as described herein. It should be understood that the geometries and the active cargo shown herein are not intended to be limited to the exemplary embodiments. 

EXAMPLE 2 

[0109] CMC-solids can be prepared with defined geometry and active cargo contents in one or more layers of the prepared structure. Examples of active cargos integrated into CMC-solids are described more detail herein. Upon construction of the CMC-solids with embedded active cargo contained in at least one layer of the CMC-solid, the CMC solids can be milled to project-specific dimensions and micro-milled to fabricate microneedle devices as described herein. 

EXAMPLE 3 

[0110] In another embodiment, one or more layers of active cargo can be embedded on CMC-solids for direct micromilling of the microneedle array. FIG. 13 illustrates a sample representation of vertical multi-layered deposition and CMC embedding of active cargos on CMC-solids for direct micro-milling of MNA devices. 

[0111] In one exemplary method, microneedle arrays can be fabricated by preparing CMC-solids with a defined geometries and without any active cargo contained therein. Then, blank CMC-solids can be milled to a desired dimension. 

[0112] As shown in FIG. 13, active cargo(s) can be deposited onto the CMC-solid in project specific geometric patterns for inclusion of the active cargo(s) specifically in the tips of micro-milled MNA devices. 

[0113] The methods active cargo deposition onto the CMC-solid blank can include, for example: 

[0114] 1) Direct printing with micro-nozzle aided droplet deposition. 

[0115] 2) Transfer from preprinted matrices. 

[0116] 3) Droplet-deposition with computer controlled robotic systems. 

[0117] FIG. 14 illustrates layering and spatial distribution of embedded active cargos in a CMC-solid block. After the first layer is deposited (A) it can be covered with a CMC layer (B) that provides the surface for the subsequent deposition of the active cargo (C). The process can be repeated until all desired layers are deposited and encased in a solid CMC-block suitable for the micro-milling process (D-F). 

[0118] FIG. 15 illustrates a schematic view of a cross-section of a CMC-block encasing the deposits of the active cargo in a spatially controlled manner (A). The method allows 3-dimensional control and placement of the active components after micro-milling in the MNA-device (B). In panel (B) of FIG. 15, the placement of the active cargos are shown in the stems of the active cargo; however through the control of the milling process the placement can be controlled vertically from the tip to the base of the microneedles. Colors represent different active components or different amount/concentration of the same material. 

[0119] Thus, a method of vertically layered deposition of active cargos in microneedles is provided by depositing one or more active cargos sequentially on the surface of the CMC-solids in contact with each other or separated by layers of CMC. In some embodiments, horizontal pattern deposition of the active cargos can result in spatial separation of the cargos. By combining vertical and horizontal patterning of active cargo deposition, 3 dimensional delivery and distribution of each of the defined active components can be achieved, further reducing waste of active components during fabrication of microneedle arrays. 

[0120] Microneedle Integrated Adenovectors 

[0121] The following embodiments are directed to dissolvable microneedle arrays, such as those described herein, that incorporate infectious viral vectors into the dissolvable matrix of microneedle arrays. Using this technology, for the first time, living viral vectors can be incorporated into microneedle arrays. As described herein, the incorporation of viral vectors within the disclosed microneedle arrays stabilizes the viral vectors so that they maintain their infectivity after incorporation and after prolonged periods of storage. The application of microneedle array incorporated adenovectors (MIAs) to the skin results in transfection of skin cells. In a vaccine setting, we have demonstrated that skin application of MIAs encoding an HIV antigen results in potent HIV specific immune responses. These results are described in detail in the examples below. 

EXAMPLE 4 

[0122] The microneedle integrated adenovectors preparation method described herein preserves the viability of the adenoviral particles during the preparation and in dry storage. These steps were specifically designed based on the physical and chemical properties of CMC microneedle arrays. Viral viability in CMC microneedle arrays was achieved by 

[0123] Inclusion of low viscosity carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC90) at 2.5% final concentration (step 2.) and by 

[0124] Timed and temperature controlled spin-drying concentration of the adenoviral particles in the tips of the microneedle array devices (step 6.). 

[0125] Controlled partial rehydration of the needle-tip loaded adenoviral particles (step 8.) 

[0126] Preparation of Tip-loaded Microneedle Integrated Adenovectors (MIAs): 

[0127] 1) Resuspend adenoviral particles at 2.times.109 particles/ml density in Trehalose-storage buffer (5% trehalose Sigma-Aldrich USA, 20 mM Tris pH7.8, 75 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.025% Tween 80) 

[0128] 2) Mix resuspended viral stock with equal volume of 5% CMC90 prepared in Trehasole-storage buffer, resulting in a 1.times.109 particles/ml density adenoviral working stock. 

[0129] 3) Add adenoviral working stock suspension to the surface of microneedle array production molds (as described in detail in other embodiments herein) at 40 .mu.l per cm2 surface area. 

[0130] 4) The molds are centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 10 minutes at 22.degree. C. to fill the needle tips with adenoviral working stock. 

[0131] 5) The excess viral stock is removed and the surface of the molds washed with 100 .mu.l (phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution per cm2 mold-surface area. 

[0132] 6) The microneedle array-molds containing the adenoviral stock solution only in the needle's cavity are partially spin-dried at 3500 rpm for 10 minutes at 22.degree. C. 

[0133] 7) 100 .mu.l 20% structural, non-cargo containing CMC90 hydrogel in H2O added to the surface microneedle array-molds' per cm2 mold-area to form the structure of the MIA device. 

[0134] 8) Centrifuge at 4500 rpm for 10 min at 22.degree. C. to fill up the needle cavities with 20% CMC90 and allow 30 min incubation for the rehydration of the adenoviral particles dried in the tips (step 3-6, above). 

[0135] 9) By centrifugation spin-dry the MIA devices to less than 5% moisture content at 3500 rpm for 3 hours at 22.degree. C. with 10 L/min constant air flow through the centrifuge chamber. 

[0136] 10) De-mold the dried MIA devices for storage at 4.degree. C. or -80.degree. C. 

EXAMPLE 5 

[0137] We have evaluated the potency and stability MNA incorporated recombinant adenoviral particles. Ad5.EGFP was incorporated into CMC hydrogel MNAs to fabricate a final product that contained 1010 virus particles/MNA. Control blank MNAs were prepared identically but without the virus. Batches of Ad5.EGFP and control MNAs were stored at RT, 4.degree. C. and at -86.degree. C. and viral stability was evaluated in infectious assays. Specific transduction activity of the MNA incorporated Ad5.EGFP virus was assessed in vitro using 293T cells. Cells were plated at 2.times.106/well in six well plates and transduced in duplicate with diluted virus suspension, suspension+empty MNA (control), or Ad5EGFP MNAs stored at RT, 4.degree. C. and -86.degree. C. for the indicated time periods. As a negative control untransduced wells were included. Initially cell populations were analyzed after 24 h by flow cytometry for GFP expression (representative histogram is shown in FIG. 35.). 

[0138] As shown in FIG. 35, the incorporation of Ad5EGFP into MNAs does not reduce transduction efficiency. Flow cytometry analysis of GFP expressing target 293T cells 24 h after transduction with identical titers of Ad5EGFP either in suspension or incorporated into CMC-patches vs. untransfected control cells. FIG. 36 shows the stability of MNA embedded Ad5EGFP virus. GFP gene expression was assayed by flow cytometry as in FIG. 37 and normalized to the infection efficiency of -86.degree. C. preserved Ad5EGFP suspension. 

[0139] It has been found that the infection efficiency using MNA Ad5EGFP virus was 87.92.+-.4.5%, which is similar to that observed for traditional -86.degree. C. preserved Ad5EGFP suspension (FIGS. 35 and 36), suggesting that the manufacturing process does not adversely affect the transduction efficiency of Ad-EGFP viral particles. To assess infectivity over time, the transfection efficiency of freshly prepared -86 .degree. C. preserved Ad5EGFP suspensions was compared to that of MNA incorporated Ad5EGFP stored for prolonged periods of time at either RT, 4 C, or -86 C. Infectivity (normalized to Ad5EGFP suspension+empty CMC-patch) is reported for storage periods of up to 365 days (FIG. 36). These results suggest that the infectiousness of MNA Ad5.EGFP is remarkably stable with storage at either 4 C or -86 C, and somewhat stable at RT for up to 30 days. 

[0140] These results demonstrate that microneedle array delivered Ad transgenes are expressed in the skin and induce potent cellular immune responses. To specifically evaluate gene expression in vivo, we determined GFP expression in skin following either traditional intradermal injection (I.D.) or microneedle array-mediated intracutaneous delivery. We delivered 108 Ad5.GFP viral particles by ID injection or topically via a single microneedle array application (FIG. 37). Skin was harvested 48 h later, cryosectioned, counter-stained using blue fluorescent DAPI to identify cell nuclei, and then imaged by fluorescent microscopy. Significant cellular GFP expression was observed following both I.D. and microneedle array delivery. To evaluate immunogenicity, we evaluated antigen-specific lytic activity in vivo following a single I.D. or microneedle array immunization without boosting. For this purpose we immunized groups of mice with E1/E3-deleted Ad5-based vectors that encode codon-optimized SIVmac239 gag full-length or SIVmac239 gag p17 antigens (Ad5.SIV gag, Ad5.SIV gag p17). Empty vector was used as a control (Ad5). We observed potent and similar levels of in vivo lytic activity specific for the dominant SIVgag p17-derived peptide KSLYNTVCV (SIVmac239 gag 76-84) following either I.D. or microneedle array immunization with either Ad5.SIV gag or Ad5.SIV gag p17 (FIG. 37, CTL). 

[0141] The microneedle array technology disclosed herein can also facilitate clinical gene therapy. It addresses, for example, at least two major limitations of conventional approaches. First, it enables stabilization and storage of recombinant viral vectors for prolonged periods of time. By rendering live virus vectors resistant to high and low temperatures with proven seroequivalence to frozen liquid formulations, microneedle array stabilization will relieve pressures related to the `cold chain.` Further, integration in microneedle arrays enables precise, consistent and reproducible dosing of viral vectors not achievable by conventional methods. Finally, the viral vector is repackaged in the only necessary delivery device, the biocompatible and completely disposable microneedle array that directs delivery precisely to the superficial layers of the skin. 

[0142] Such a gene delivery platform is useful in providing patient-friendly, clinical gene therapy. Since these microneedle arrays have been engineered to not penetrate to the depth of vascular or neural structures, gene delivery to human skin will be both painless and bloodless. In addition, the fabrication process is flexible, enabling simple and rapid low cost production with efficient scale-up potential. Also, as a final product, the MIA device it is stable at room temperature and is inexpensive to transport and store. In combination, these structural and manufacturing advantages can enable broad and rapid clinical deployment, making this gene delivery technology readily applicable to the prevention and/or treatment of a broad range of human diseases. Moreover, this approach can be extended to other vector-based vaccine platforms that are currently restricted by the same limitations (e.g., vaccinia virus, AAV etc.). For at least these reasons, the disclosed microneedle arrays and methods of using the same significantly advance the recombinant gene therapy field. 

[0143] Microneedle Arrays--Exemplary Active Components 

[0144] Various active components are described in detail below. For convenience, the following examples are based on an microneedle array which is 6.3.times.6.3 mm This size, and hence cargo delivery can be varied by increasing or decreasing 2-100 fold. 

[0145] General considerations for the maximum active cargo quantities include, for example, total needle volume in the array and solubility of the active component(s) in the solvent (generally expected to be <50%).

[0146] Tip-loading of live adenoviruses generally includes the following modifications: 

[0147] a) The presence of 5% trehalose and 2.5% CMC90 in the tip-loading hydrogel suspension. 

[0148] b) The temperature of the process is maintained at 22 .degree. C. 

[0149] In addition, Lenti viral vectors generally require 4.degree. C. processing and vapor trap based humidity controls. Also, short epitope peptides generally are solubilized in DMSO, with the evaporation time of the solvent during tip-loading is 4 hours. 

[0150] The amounts of the above agents can vary depending on specific applications, and are generally selected to be in an amount sufficient to provide a therapeutic effect, either alone or in combination with other agents or materials. For example, in some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of doxorubicin can be about 25 to 300 micrograms, about 50 to 200 micrograms, or, in other embodiments, about 75 to 125 micrograms. As used herein, "about" means plus or minus five percent of an amount. For example, "about 50 to 200 micrograms" includes 47.5 to 210 micrograms. 

[0151] Microneedle Structures and Shapes 

[0152] For each of the embodiments below, it should be understood that one or more layers of active components can be provided in the microneedles of the microneedle arrays as described above. Thus, for example, in some embodiments, active components are only provided in the area of the microneedle--not in the structural support of the array, such as shown in FIG. 15. Moreover, in other embodiments, the active components are concentrated in the upper half of the microneedles, such as in the tips of the microneedles as shown in FIGS. 3A-4B. 

[0153] FIGS. 16A and 16B are SEM images of a CMC-microneedle array formed with a plurality of pyramidal projections (i.e., microneedles). The average tip diameter of the pyramidal needles shown in FIG. 16A is about 5-10 .mu.m. As shown in FIG. 16B, the sides of the pyramidal needles can be formed with curved and/or arcuate faces that can facilitate insertion in skin. 

[0154] FIG. 17 is another SEM image of a single needle of a microneedle array. The microneedle shown in FIG. 17 is a base-extended pillar type molded CMC-microneedle. The base-extended pillar type microneedle comprises a base portion, which is generally polyagonal (for example, rectangular) in cross section, and a projecting portion that extends from the base portion. The projecting portion has a lower portion that is substantially rectangular and tip portion that generally tapers to a point. The tip portion is generally pyramidal in shape, and the exposed faces of the pyramid can be either flat or arcuate. The projecting portion can be half or more the entire length of the needle. 

[0155] FIGS. 18 and 19 illustrate micrographs of pyramidal (FIG. 18) and pillar type (FIG. 19) molded CMC-microneedles. Because the pyramidal needles have a continually increasing cross-sectional profile (dimension) from the needle point to the needle base, as the needle enters the skin, the force required to continue pushing the pyramidal needle into the skin increases. In contrast, pillar type needles have a generally continuous cross-sectional profile (dimension) once the generally rectangular portion of the projection portion is reached. Thus, pillar type needles can be preferable over pyramidal type needles because they can allow for the introduction of the needle into the skin with less force. 

[0156] FIG. 20 illustrates schematic representation of microneedle shapes and structures that are generally suitable for fabrication by spin-casting material into a mastermold formed by micromilling Since the shapes and structures shown in FIG. 20 do not contain any undercuts, they generally will not interfere with the molding/de-molding process. The structures in FIG. 20 include (a) a generally pyramidal microneedle, (b) a "sharp" pillar type microneedle (without the base member of FIG. 8), (c) a "wide" pillar type microneedle, (d) a "short" pillar type microneedle (having a short pillar section and a longer pointed section), and (e) a "filleted" pillar type microneedle. 

[0157] While the volume of the pyramidal microneedles can be greater than that of the pillar type microneedles, their increasing cross-sectional profile (dimension) requires an increasing insertion force. Accordingly, the geometry of the pyramidal microneedles can result in reduced insertion depths and a reduced effective delivery volume. On the other hand, the smaller cross-sectional area and larger aspect ratio of the pillar microneedles may cause the failure force limit to be lower. The smaller the apex angle .alpha., the "sharper" the tip of the microneedle. However, by making the apex angle too small (e.g., below about 30 degrees), the resulting microneedle volume and mechanical strength may be reduced to an undesirable level. 

[0158] The penetration force of a microneedle is inversely proportional to the microneedle sharpness, which is characterized not only by the included (apex) angle of the microneedles, but also by the radius of the microneedle tip. While the apex angle is prescribed by the mastermold geometry, the tip sharpness also depends on the reliability of the mold. Micromilling of mastermolds as described herein allows for increased accuracy in mold geometry which, in turn, results in an increased accuracy and reliability in the resulting production mold and the microneedle array formed by the production mold. 

[0159] The increased accuracy of micromilling permits more accurate and detailed elements to be included in the mold design. For example, as discussed in the next section below, the formation of a fillet at the base of a pillar type microneedle can significantly increase the structural integrity of the microneedle, which reduces the likelihood that the microneedle will fail or break when it impacts the skin. While these fillets can significantly increase the strength of the microneedles, they do not interfere with the functional requirements of the microneedles (e.g., penetration depth and biologics volume). Such fillets are very small features that can be difficult to create in a master mold formed by conventional techniques. However, the micromilling techniques described above permit the inclusion of such small features with little or no difficulty. 

[0160] Mechanical Integrity and Penetration Capabilities 

[0161] Microneedle arrays are preferably configured to penetrate the stratum corneum to deliver their cargo (e.g., biologics or bioactive components) to the epidermis and/or dermis, while minimizing pain and bleeding by preventing penetration to deeper layers that may contain nerve endings and vessels. To assess the mechanical viability of the fabricated microneedle arrays, tests were performed on the pyramidal and pillar type microneedle arrays as representative variants of array geometry (shown, e.g., in FIGS. 7B and 8). The first set of tests illustrate the failure limit of microneedles, and include pressing the microneedle array against a solid acrylic surface with a constant approach speed, while simultaneously measuring the force and the displacement until failure occurs. The second set of tests illustrate the piercing capability of the microneedles on human skin explants. 

[0162] FIG. 21 illustrates a test apparatus designed for functional testing. The sample (i.e., microneedle array) was attached to a fixture, which was advanced toward a stationary acrylic artifact (PMMA surface) at a constant speed of about 10 mm/s speed using a computer-controlled motion stage (ES14283-52 Aerotech, Inc.). A tri-axial dynamometer (9256C1, Kistler, Inc.) that hosted the acrylic artifact enabled high-sensitivity measurement of the forces. 

[0163] FIG. 22 illustrates force-displacement curves of data measured during failure tests. The curve on the left is representative of data obtained from testing a pillar microneedle sample and the curve on the right is representative of data obtained from testing a pyramid microneedle. As seen in FIG. 22, the failure of these two kinds of microneedles are significantly different; while the pyramidal arrays plastically deform (bend), the pillar type arrays exhibit breakage of the pillars at their base. This different failure behavior lends itself to considerably different displacement-force data. The failure (breakage) event can be easily identified from the displacement-force data as indicated in the figure. Based on the obtained data, the failure point of pillar type microneedles was seen to be 100 mN in average. As only about 40 mN of force is required for penetration through the stratum corneum, the microneedles are strong enough to penetrate human skin without failure. Furthermore, since parallelism between microneedle tips and the acrylic artifact cannot be established perfectly, the actual failure limit will likely be significantly higher than 100 mN (i.e., microneedles broke in a successive manner, rather than simultaneous breakage of most/all microneedles). 

[0164] The pyramidal microneedles presented a continuously increasing force signature with no clear indication of point of failure. To identify the failure limit for the pyramidal microneedles, interrupted tests were conducted in which the microneedles were advanced into the artifact by a certain amount, and retreated and examined through optical microscope images. This process was continued until failure was observed. For this purpose, the failure was defined as the bending of the pyramidal microneedles beyond 15 degrees. 

[0165] To further analyze the failure of the microneedles, the finite-elements model (FEM) of the microneedle arrays shown in FIG. 23 was developed. To obtain the mechanical properties (elastic modulus and strength limit) of the CMC material, a series of nanoindentation tests (using a Hysitron nanoindentor). The average elastic modulus and yield strength of the CMC material (as prepared) were 10.8 GPa and 173 MPa, respectively. This indicates that the prepared CMC material has a higher elastic modulus and yield strength than both PMMA (elastic modulus: 3.1 GPa, yield strength: 103 MPa) and polycarbonate (elastic modulus: 2.2 GPa, yield strength: 75 MPa), indicating the superior strength and stiffness of CMC material with respect to other polymers. 

[0166] Using this data, a series of FEM simulations were conducted. It was predicted from the FEM models that failure limit of pyramidal and sharp-pillar (width=134 .mu.m) microneedles with 600 .mu.m height, 30 degree apex angle, and 20 .mu.m fillet radius were 400 mN (pyramid) and 290 mN (sharp-pillar) for asymmetric loading (5 degrees loading misorientation). Considering that the minimum piercing force requirement is about 40 mN, pyramid and sharp-pillar microneedles would have factors of safety of about 10 and 7.25, respectively. 

[0167] When the fillet radius is doubled to 40 .mu.m, the failure load for the pillar was increased to 350 mN, and when the fillet radius is reduced to 5 .mu.m, the failure load was reduced to 160 mN, which is close to the experimentally determined failure load. The height and width of the pillars had a significant effect on failure load. For instance, for 100 .mu.m width pillars, increasing the height from 500 .mu.m to 1000 .mu.m reduced the failure load from 230 mN to 150 mN. When the width is reduced to 75 .mu.m, for a 750 .mu.m high pillar, the failure load was seen to be 87 mN. 

[0168] To evaluate penetration capability, pyramidal and sharp-pillar microneedle arrays were tested for piercing on water-based model elastic substrates and on full thickness human skin. FIG. 24 illustrates stereo micrographs of pyramidal (Panels A, C, and E) and pillar type microneedle arrays (B, D, and F) after 4 minutes of exposure to model elastics. In particular, toluene blue tracer dye was deposited in model elastic substrates (Panels C and D) or freshly excised full thickness human skin explants (Panels E and F) after application of pyramidal or pillar type microneedle arrays. 

[0169] The model elastic substrate comprised about 10% CMC and about 10% porcine gelatin in PBS gelled at about 4 degrees Celsius for about 24 hours or longer. The surface of the elastics was covered with about 100 .mu.m thick parafilm to prevent the immediate contact of the needle-tips and the patch materials with the water based model elastics. To enable stereo microscopic-imaging, trypan blue tracer dye (Sigma Chem., cat #T6146) was incorporated into the CMC-hydrogel at 0.1% concentration. The patches were applied using a spring-loaded applicator and analyzed after about a 4 minute exposure. Based on physical observation of the dye in the target substrates, the dissolution of the microneedles of the two different geometries was markedly different. 

[0170] The sharp-pillar needles applied to the model elastic substrate released substantially more tracer dye to the gel matrix than that observed for the pyramidal design (FIG. 24, C vs. D). Images of the recovered patches (FIG. 24, A vs. B) were consistent with this observation, as the degradation of the sharp-pillar needles was more advanced than that of the pyramidal needles. To extrapolate this analysis to a more clinically relevant model, pyramidal and pillar type microneedle arrays were applied to freshly excised full thickness human skin explants using the same force from the spring loaded applicator. Consistent with results from the elastic model, the pyramidal microneedle arrays deposited visibly less tracer dye than the sharp-pillar microneedle arrays (FIG. 24, E vs. F). 

[0171] To further evaluate penetration and to assess delivery effectiveness to human skin, CMC-microneedle arrays were fabricated with BioMag (Polysciences, Inc., cat #. 84100) beads or fluorescent particulate tracers (Fluoresbrite YG 1 .mu.m, Polysciences Inc., cat #. 15702). The pyramidal CMC-microneedle arrays containing fluorescent or solid particulates were applied to living human skin explants as described previously. Five minutes after the application, surface residues were removed and skin samples were cryo-sectioned and then counterstained with toluene blue for imaging by light microscopy (FIGS. 25A and 25B) or by fluorescent microscopy (FIG. 25C). 

[0172] Pyramidal CMC-microneedles effectively penetrated the stratum corneum, epidermis, and dermis of living human skin explants, as evidenced by the deposition of Biomag beads lining penetration cavities corresponding to individual needle insertion points (representative sections shown in FIGS. 25A and 25B). In particular, ordered cavities (FIG. 25A, cavities numbered 1-4, toluene blue counterstain, 10.times.) and deposits of BioMag particles (brown) lining penetration cavities were evident (FIG. 25B, 40.times.), indicating microneedle penetrated of human skin. Further, analysis of sections from living human explants stained with DAPI to identify cell nuclei and anti-HLA-DR to identify MHC class II+antigen presenting cells revealed high density fluorescent particulates deposited in the superficial epidermis and dermis, including several particles co-localized with class II+antigen presenting cells (FIG. 25C, DAPI (blue), HLA-DR+ (red) and fluorescent particles (green), 40.times.). 

[0173] These results further demonstrate that the CMC microneedle arrays described herein can effectively penetrate human skin and deliver integral cargo (bioactive components), including insoluble particulates. They are consistent with effective delivery of particulate antigens to antigen presenting cells in human skin, currently a major goal of rational vaccine design. 

[0174] To further address microneedle array delivery in vivo, the cutaneous delivery of particulate antigen in vivo was modeled by similarly applying fluorescent particle containing arrays to the dorsal aspect of the ears of anesthetized mice. After 5 minutes, patches were removed and mice resumed their normal activity. Three hours or 3 days, ear skin and draining lymph nodes were analyzed for the presence of fluorescent particles. Consistent with observations of human skin, particulates were evident in the skin excised from the array application site (data not shown). Further, at the 3 day time point, substantial numbers of particles were evident in the draining lymph nodes . FIGS. 26A and 26B illustrates substantial numbers of particles that were evident in the draining lymph Nodes (FIG. 26A, 10.times.), including clusters of particulates closely associated with Class II+cells (FIG. 26B, 60.times.) suggesting the presence of lymph node resident antigen presenting cells with internalized particulates. 

[0175] To quantitatively evaluate the effects of needle geometry on cargo delivery using microneedle arrays, 3H-tracer labeled CMC-microneedle arrays were constructed. The CMC-hydrogel was prepared with 5% wt ovalbumin as a model active component at 25 wt % final dry weight content (5 g/95 g OVA/CMC) and trace labeled with 0.1 wt % trypan blue and 0.5.times.106 dpm/mg dry weight 3H-tracer in the form of 3H-thymidine (ICN Inc., cat #2406005). From a single batch of labeled CMC-hydrogel-preparation four batches of 3H-CMC-microneedle arrays were fabricated, containing several individual patches of pyramidal and sharp-pillar needle geometry. The patches were applied to human skin explants as described above and removed after 30 min exposure. The patch-treated area was tape-striped to remove surface debris and cut using a 10 mm biopsy punch. The 3H content of the excised human skin explants-discs was determined by scintillation counting. The specific activity of the 3H-CMC-microneedle patch-material was determined and calculated to be 72,372 cpm/mg dry weight. This specific activity was used to indirectly determine the amount of ovalbumin delivered to and retained in the skin. The resulting data is summarized in Table 1 below. 

[0176] The tested types of patches were consistent from microneedle array to microneedle array (average standard deviation 24-35%) and batch to batch (average standard deviation 7-19%). The intra-batch variability for both needle geometry was lower than the in-batch value indicating that the insertion process and the characteristics of the target likely plays a primary role in the successful transdermal material delivery and retention. The patch-material retention data clearly demonstrate the foremost importance of the microneedle geometry in transdermal cargo delivery. Pillar-type needle geometry afforded an overall 3.89 fold greater deposition of the 3H labeled needle material than that of the pyramidal needles. On the basis of the deposited radioactive material, it is estimated that the pyramidal needles were inserted about 200 .mu.m deep while the pillar-type were inserted about 400 .mu.m or more.

[0177] Desirably, the microneedle arrays described herein can be used for cutaneous immunization. The development of strategies for effective delivery of antigens and adjuvants is a major goal of vaccine design, and immunization strategies targeting cutaneous dendritic cells have various advantages over traditional vaccines. 

[0178] Cancer Therapy Applications 

[0179] Bioactive components used with the microneedle arrays described herein can include one or more chemotherapeutic agents. Effective and specific delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to tumors, including skin tumors is a major goal of modern tumor therapy. However, systemic delivery of chemotherapeutic agents is limited by multiple well-established toxicities. In the case of cutaneous tumors, including skin derived tumors (such as basal cell, squamous cell, Merkel cell, and melanomas) and tumors metastatic to skin (such as breast cancer, melanoma), topical delivery can be effective. Current methods of topical delivery generally require the application of creams or repeated local injections. The effectiveness of these approaches is currently limited by limited penetration of active agents into the skin, non-specificity, and unwanted side effects. 

[0180] The microneedle arrays of the present disclosure can be used as an alternative to or in addition to traditional topical chemotherapy approaches. The microneedle arrays of the present disclosure can penetrate the outer layers of the skin and effectively deliver the active biologic to living cells in the dermis and epidermis. Delivery of a chemotherapeutic agents results in the apoptosis and death of skin cells. 

[0181] Further, multiple bioactive agents can be delivered in a single microneedle array (patch). This enables an immunochemotherapeutic approach based on the co-delivery of a cytotoxic agent with and immune stimulant (adjuvants). In an immunogenic environment created by the adjuvant, tumor antigens releases from dying tumor cells will be presented to the immune system, inducing a local and systemic anti-tumor immune response capable of rejecting tumor cells at the site of the treatment and throughout the body. 

EXAMPLE 6 

[0182] In an exemplary embodiment, the delivery of a biologically active small molecule was studied. In particular, the activity of the chemotherapeutic agent Cytoxan.RTM. delivered to the skin with CMC microneedle arrays was studied. The use of Cytoxan.RTM. enables direct measurement of biologic activity (Cytoxan.RTM. induced apoptosis in the skin) with a representative of a class of agents with potential clinical utility for the localized treatment of a range of cutaneous malignancies. 

[0183] To directly evaluate the immunogenicity of CMC microneedle array incorporated antigens, the well characterized model antigen ovalbumin was used. Pyramidal arrays were fabricated incorporating either soluble ovalbumin (sOVA), particulate ovalbumin (pOVA), or arrays containing both pOVA along with CpGs. The adjuvant effects of CpGs are well characterized in animal models, and their adjuvanticity in humans is currently being evaluated in clinical trials. 

[0184] Immunization was achieved by applying antigen containing CMC-microneedle arrays to the ears of anesthetized mice using a spring-loaded applicator as described above, followed by removal of the arrays 5 minutes after application. These pyramidal microneedle arrays contained about 5 wt % OVA in CMC and about 0.075 wt % (20 .mu.M) CpG. As a positive control, gene gun based genetic immunization strategy using plasmid DNA encoding OVA was used. Gene gun immunization is among the most potent and reproducible methods for the induction of CTL mediated immune responses in murine models, suggesting its use as a "gold standard" for comparison in these assays. 

[0185] Mice were immunized, boosted one week later, and then assayed for OVA-specific CTL activity in vivo. Notably, immunization with arrays containing small quantities of OVA and CpG induced high levels of CTL activity, similar to those observed by gene gun immunization (FIG. 27). Significant OVA-specific CTL activity was elicited even in the absence of adjuvant, both with particulate and soluble array delivered OVA antigen. It is well established that similar responses require substantially higher doses of antigen when delivered by traditional needle injection. 

[0186] To evaluate the stability of fabricated arrays, batches of arrays were fabricated, stored, and then used over an extended period of time. As shown in FIG. 28, no significant deterioration of immunogenicity was observed over storage periods spanning up to 80 days (longest time point evaluated). Thus, the CMC microneedle arrays and this delivery technology can enable effective cutaneous delivery of antigen and adjuvants to elicit antigen specific immunity. 

[0187] To evaluate the delivery of a biologically active small molecule, pyramidal CMC-microneedle arrays were fabricated with the low molecular weight chemotherapeutic agent Cytoxan.RTM. (cyclophosphamide), or with FluoresBrite green fluorescent particles as a control. Cytoxan.RTM. was integrated at a concentration of 5 mg/g of CMC, enabling delivery of approximately about 140 .mu.g per array. This is a therapeutically relevant concentration based on the area of skin targeted, yet well below levels associated with systemic toxicities. Living human skin organ cultures were used to assess the cytotoxicty of Cytoxan.RTM.. Cytoxan.RTM. was delivered by application of arrays to skin explants as we previously described. Arrays and residual material were removed 5 minutes after application, and after 72 hours of exposure, culture living skin explants were cryo-sectioned and fixed. Apoptosis was evaluated using green fluorescent TUNEL assay (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, TMR Green, Roche, cat #:11-684-795-910). Fluorescent microscopic image analysis of the human skin sections revealed extensive apoptosis of epidermal cells in Cytoxan.RTM. treated skin as shown in FIG. 29A. As shown in FIG. 29B, no visible apoptosis was observed in fluorescent particle treated skin though these particles were evident, validating that the observed area was accurately targeted by the microneedle array. 

EXAMPLE 7 

[0188] In another embodiment, topical treatment of established tumors with doxorubicin and/or Poly(I:C) integrated into MNAs established tumor regression and durable immunity that can protect from subsequent lethal systemic tumor challenges. 

[0189] Novel therapeutic approaches for treating established skin tumors were provided based on the combined effect of MNA delivered chemotherapy, MNA delivered immunostimulant therapy, and/or MNAs delivering combination chemo-immunotherapy. The B16 melanoma model was used as a model tumor to test these novel approaches. The B16 melanoma model is very well studied, and is one of the most aggressive murine skin cancers. Of all skin tumor models available, an established B16 tumor is among the most difficult to treat. Further, B16 has a very high metastatic potential, enabling a clinically relevant assessment of systemic tumor immunity 

[0190] B16 skin tumors were established in normal mice by injection. Visible established cutaneous tumors were treated once weekly for three weeks with MNAs containing either doxorubicin alone, Poly(I:C) alone, or doxorubicin and Poly(I:C) incorporated into the same MNA. The doxorubicin dose chosen corresponds to an MNA dose that induces apoptosis in human skin without causing necrosis. Tumor growth and survival were measured regularly for the duration of the study. As shown in FIGS. 41A and 41D, treatment with MNAs containing doxorubicin alone slowed tumor growth, and improved survival (30%) compared to that observed in untreated tumor bearing animals that had a 100% mortality rate. Further, treatment with MNAs containing Poly(I:C) alone slowed tumor growth (FIG. 41B), and improved survival (50%) compared to that observed in untreated tumor bearing animals that had a 100% mortality rate (FIG. 41D). Remarkably, treatment with containing both doxorubicin+Poly(I:C) substantially slowed tumor growth in all animals (FIG. 41C), and eradicated tumors completely in 8 out of 10 mice. This was reflected in 80% long term survival extending through day 70 (FIG. 41D). 

[0191] Representative images of control and treated animals are shown in FIGS. 42 and 43. Surviving animals were evaluated to determine whether they developed long-term immunity against these same tumors. Specifically, systemic immunity was evaluated in these animals, including the durability of the immune response and the capacity of surviving animals to survive IV challenge. In particular, sixty days after the initial MNA treatment, mice were treated with a lethal dose of B16. Fourteen days later, mice were sacrificed and lung metastases were quantified microscopically. Treated mice demonstrated dramatically reduced numbers of lung lesions compared to naive controls (FIGS. 44-46). Taken together, these results demonstrate the capacity of MNAs to deliver chemotherapeutic agents, immune stimulants, and combinations of these agents to both induce regression of established skin tumors, and to simultaneously induce durable systemic tumor specific immune responses capable of protecting the subject from subsequent tumors. 

[0192] In another embodiment, Poly-ICLC can be substituted for Poly(I:C), and MNAs can be formed, for example, with Poly-ICLC in combination with at least one other chemotherapeutic agent (e.g., doxorubicin). 

[0193] As discussed above, the one or more chemotherapeutic agents can include one or more immunostimulants agents (specific and non-specific) known by those skilled in the art to stimulate the immune system to reject and destroy tumors, such as Poly(I:C) and Poly-ICLC. These immunostimulants can be integrated into the MNAs along with other chemotherapeutic agents, such as cytotoxic agents like doxorubicin Immunostimulants that can be used in the manner described herein include adjuvants, toll-like receptors (TLRs), ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides, double stranded RNAs (dsRNA), and derivatives of Poly(I:C). 

[0194] The one or more chemotherapeutic agents can include various anthracycline agents. For example, as discussed above, doxorubicin can be integrated into MNAs. Other examples of anthracycline agents include, for example, daunorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, valrubicin, and mitoxantrone. In some embodiments, at least two different anthracycline agents can be integrated in the same MNA. As discussed in more detail herein, MNAs can be formed with CMC or other suitable polymers. Thus, at least one anthracyline agent (e.g., doxorubicin) or two or more anthracyline agents (e.g., doxorubicin and another anthracycline agent) can be integrated into MNAs that include polymers, such as CMC. 

[0195] Direct Fabricated Microneedle Arrays 

[0196] The micromilling of mastermolds described above allows the production of microneedle arrays with a variety of geometries. In another embodiment, systems and methods are provided for fabricating a microneedle array by directly micromilling various materials, such as dried CMC sheets. The same general tooling that was described above with respect to the micromilling of mastermolds can be used to directly micromilling microneedle arrays. 

[0197] Direct micromilling of microneedle arrays eliminates the need for molding steps and enables a simplified, scalable, and precisely reproducible production strategy that will be compatible with large scale clinical use. Moreover, direct fabrication of the microneedle arrays through micromilling enables greater control of microneedle geometries. For example, micromilling permits the inclusion of microneedle retaining features such as undercuts and/or bevels, which cannot be achieved using molding processes. 

[0198] The reproducibility of direct milling of microneedle arrays is particular beneficial. That is, in direct micromilling all of the microneedles are identical as a result of the milling fabrication process. In molding operations, it is not uncommon for some needles to be missing or broken from a given patch as a result of the process of physically separating them from the molds. For use in certain medical applications, the reproducibility of the amount of bioactive components in the array is very important to provide an appropriate level of "quality control" over the process, since irregularities in the needles from patch to patch would likely result in variability in the dose of drug/vaccine delivered. Of course, reproducibility will also be an important benefit to any application that requires FDA approval. Spincast/molded patches would require special processes to assure acceptable uniformity for consistent drug delivery. This quality control would also be likely to result in a certain percentage of the patches "failing" this release test, introducing waste into the production process. Direct micromilling eliminates or at least significantly reduces these potential problems. 

[0199] Molding processes also have inherent limitations because of the need to be able to fill a well or concavity and remove the cured molded part from that well or concavity. That is because of mold geometries, undercuts must generally be avoided when molding parts or the part will not be removable from the mold. That is, a geometrical limitation of a molded part, such as a molded microneedle array, is that any feature located closer to the apex must be narrower than any feature located toward the base. 

[0200] Accordingly, in view of these limitations, FIG. 20 illustrates schematic representation of microneedle shapes and structures that are generally suitable for fabrication by molding. That is, the shapes and structures shown in FIG. 20 do not contain any undercuts that would prevent the part (i.e., the microneedles) from being removed from a production mold. In contrast, FIG. 30 illustrates a beveled, undercut microneedle shape that cannot be molded in the manners described herein. 

[0201] This geometry can only be created through direct fabrication using the proposed micromilling technology. The negative (bevel) angle facilitates better retention of the microneedles in the tissue. In addition, because the microneedle of FIG. 30 has a wider intermediate portion (with a larger cross-sectional dimension) above a lower portion (with a smaller cross-sectional dimension), a greater amount of the bioactive material can be delivered by configuring the microneedle to hold or store the bioactive material in the wider section, which is configured to be retained within the skin. Thus, the larger cross-sectional dimension of the intermediate portion can "carry" the bulk of the bioactive component. Since the lower portion tapers to a narrower cross-sectional dimension, the wider intermediate portion will obtain good penetration for delivery of the bioactive component into the skin layer. A portion above the intermediate portion desirably narrows to a point to facilitate entry of the microneedles into the skin layers. 

[0202] Another limitation of molded parts is that it can be difficult to precisely fill a very small section of a mold. Since production molds for microneedle arrays comprise numerous very small sections, it can be difficult to accurately fill each well. This can be particularly problematic when the mold must be filled with different materials, such as a material that contains a bioactive component and a material that does not contain a bioactive component. Thus, if the production mold is to be filled with layers, it can be difficult to accurately fill the tiny wells that are associated with each microneedle. Such reproducibility is particularly important, since the microneedles are intended to deliver one or more bioactive components. Thus, even slight variations in the amounts of bioactive component used to fill production molds can be very undesirable. 

[0203] Also, by using a lamination structure to form a sheet or block that can be micromilled, various active components can be integrated into a single microneedle by vertical layering. For example, in an exemplary embodiment, CMC-hydrogel and CMC-sOVA-hydrogel (80% CMC/20 wt % OVA) were layered into the form of a sheet or block. This composite sheet can be micro-machined using the direct micromilling techniques described herein. 

[0204] FIG. 31 is a stereo-microscopic image analysis of an entire microneedle array. The microneedle comprises a 10.times.10 array of microneedles. FIG. 32 is an enlarged segment of the microneedle array of FIG. 31. The layering of two components is shown in FIG. 32, which illustrates darker areas of the microneedles at tip portions and lighter areas of the microneedles at base portions. The darker layer at the tip represents the layer comprising a bioactive component, in this case soluble ovalbumin contained in a CMC layer. 

[0205] Although the formation of a layer containing active material (e.g., antigen) and the subsequent micromilling of the layer (and any other adjacent layers) may require the use of relatively large amounts of the active material, the material can be removed (e.g., in the form of chips), recovered, and recycled. Direct machining technology is not restricted by the geometrical constraints arising from the molding/de-molding approach, and thus, is capable of creating more innovative needle designs (e.g., FIG. 30), which can significantly improve the retained needle-volume and needle retention time in the skin. 

[0206] The production of sheets or blocks by forming a plurality of layers can provide a solid material that can be micro-machined and which can comprise one or more layers with a bioactive component. For example, a dissoluble solid carboxymethylcellulose polymer based block or sheet with well-defined and controlled dimensions can be fabricated by a lamination process. The resulting sheet or block can be fully machineable, similar to the machining of plastic or metal sheets or blocks. As described herein, the fabrication process can be suitable for the incorporation of bioactive components into the matrix without significantly reducing their activity levels. 

[0207] As described below, a fabricated sheet of material (such as a CMC based material) can be directly micro-machined/micromilled) to produce one or more microneedle arrays suitable for delivering active ingredients through the skin. This dissoluble biocompatible CMC block-material can be used for the delivery of soluble or insoluble and particulate agents in a time release manner for body surface application. 

[0208] The biocompatible material can be suitable for implants in deeper soft or hard tissue when dissolution of the scaffolding material is required and useful. 

[0209] The following method can be used to prepare a carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) polymer low viscosity hydrogel to 12.5% concentration. The 12.5% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) low viscosity hydrogel can be prepared in water or other biocompatible buffer, such as (but not limited to) PBS or HBS. During the preparation of the polymer solution, soluble agents (such as nucleic acid, peptides, proteins, lipids or other organic and inorganic biologically active components) and particulates can be added (e.g. ovalbumin, a soluble agent). Ferrous particulates carrying active ingredients at 20 w/w % of CMC can be used. 

[0210] The preparation of 1000 g sterile 12.5% CMC hydrogel with no active component can be achieved as follows: 

[0211] 1) Measure 125 g CMC, add 875 g water or other water based solvent. 

[0212] 2) Stir to homogeneity in overhead mixer. 

[0213] 3) Autoclave homogenate to sterility at 121 degrees Celsius for 1 hour (the autoclaving step can reduce viscosity for improved layering) 

[0214] 4) Cool to 22 degrees Celsius. 

[0215] 5) Vacuum treat the resulting material at 10 torr and 22 degrees Celsius for 1 hour to remove trapped micro-bubbles. 

[0216] 6) Centrifuge product at 25,000 g for 1 hour in vacuum chambered centrifuge (for floating and further removing residual micro bubbles). 

[0217] 7) Store the CMC-hydrogel product at 4 degrees Celsius. 

[0218] The preparation of 1000 g sterile 12.5 w/w % dry content 20/80% ovalbumin/CMC hydrogel can be achieved as follows: 

[0219] 1) Measure 100 g CMC add 650 g water or other water based solvent. 

[0220] 2) Stir to homogeneity in overhead mixer. 

[0221] 3) Autoclave homogenate to sterility at 121 degrees Celsius for 1 hour (this autoclaving step can reduce viscosity for improved layering). 

[0222] 4) Cool to 22 degrees Celsius. 

[0223] 5a) Dissolve 25 g ovalbumin in 225 g water. 

[0224] 5b) Sterile filter ovalbumin solution on 0.22 .mu.m pore sized filter. 

[0225] 6) Mix to homogeneity, under sterile conditions the 750 g CMC hydrogel with 250 g sterile ovalbumin solution. 

[0226] 7) Vacuum treat the resulting material at 10 torr and 22 degrees Celsius for 1 hour to remove trapped micro-bubbles. 

[0227] 8) Centrifuge product at 25,000 g for 1 hour in vacuum chambered centrifuge (for floating and further removing residual micro bubbles). 

[0228] 9) Store the CMC-hydrogel product at 4 degrees Celsius. 

[0229] The preparation of 100 g sterile 12.5 w/w % dry content 20/80% particulate-ovalbumin/CMC hydrogel can be achieved as follows: 

[0230] 1) Measure 10 g CMC add 87.5 g water or other water based solvent. 

[0231] 2) Stir to homogeneity in overhead mixer. 

[0232] 3) Autoclave homogenate to sterility at 121 degrees Celsius for 1 hour (this autoclaving step can reduce viscosity for improved layering). 

[0233] 4) Cool to 22 degrees Celsius. 

[0234] 5) Disperse 2.5 g particulate-ovalbumin in the 97.5 g, 22 degrees Celsius CMC-hydrogel and mix to homogeneity, under sterile conditions. 

[0235] 6) Vacuum treat the resulting material at 10 torr and 22 degrees Celsius for 2 hour to remove trapped micro-bubbles. 

[0236] 7) Centrifuge product at 3,000 g for 1 hour in vacuum chambered centrifuge (for floating and further removing residual micro bubbles). 

[0237] 8) Store the CMC-hydrogel product at 4 degrees Celsius. 

[0238] Note in this example, particulate-ovalbumin is prepared from activated iron beads reaction to ovalbumin However, it should be noted that the above descriptions are only exemplary embodiments and other compounds and active ingredients can be used. 

[0239] A solid block/sheet carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) can be fabricated in the following manner using the low viscosity CMC-hydrogels described above. 

[0240] The fabrication process can comprise a laminar spreading of the polymer at a defined thickness and a drying of the layered polymer to less than about 5% water content using sterile dried air flow over the surface of the polymer layer. The above two acts can repeated until the desired block thickness is achieved. 

[0241] A method of performing a laminar CMC-hydrogel layering of a defined thickness over the casting mold assembly is described with reference to FIG. 33. FIG. 33 illustrates a cross-sectional view of the casting-mold assembly which includes: (a) casting bed; (b) adjustable casting bed wall; (c) casting-bed depth adjustment assembly; and (d) an acrylic spreader. It should be noted that FIG. 33 is not drawn to scale or otherwise shown with elements in their proper proportions. 

[0242] The casting mold assembly can be constructed from acrylic (Plexiglas) and can comprise a casting bed base unit, a vertically adjustable hydrophobic casting-bed wall, and a casting-bed adjustment mechanism. The casting bed base unit (a1) can include a removable/replaceable casting bed top plate (a2) with an attached cellulose layer (a3). The cellulose layer can be about 0 5 mm in thickness. The vertically adjustable hydrophobic casting-bed wall (b) can be adjusted using the casting-bed depth adjustment mechanism, which can be comprised of lead-screw (c1) and level adjustment knob (c2). In the illustrated embodiment, a quarter turn of this knob can result in a 0.5 mm lift of the bed wall. 

[0243] Initially, the adjustable casting bed wall can be set to height where the distance between the acrylic spreader and the cellulose layer of the bed is about 1 mm when the spreader is in position. A predefined volume (e.g., about 0.1 ml/cm2) of the 12.5% CMC-hydrogel can be added and layered. The layer can be evened or leveled by sliding the acrylic spreader (d) on the top surface of the adjustable casting wall to yield an even layer of about 1 mm of CMC-hydrogel. The layered CMC-hydrogel can be dried to a solid phase in the drying apparatus shown in FIG. 34 and described in more detail below. 

[0244] The layering and drying steps can be repeated until the desired layered structure (sheet) is achieved. The casting bed wall can be raised by an appropriate amount during the addition of each layer. For example, after adding each layer, the bed wall can be raised or lifted by about 0.5 mm. Thus, the above-described cycle can deposit about 0.5 mm solid CMC layer. The process (e.g., the layering of material, the raising of bed wall, etc.) can be repeated until the desired block thickness achieved. 

[0245] The layered CMC-hydrogel polymer can be dried in various manners. For example, FIG. 34 illustrates a drying apparatus that can be used to dry the various deposited layers of the sheet material. It should be noted that FIG. 34 is not drawn to scale or otherwise shown with elements in their proper proportions. A fan can provide continuous gas flow (e.g., air or other inert gas, such as nitrogen) over the CMC-hydrogel layered in the casting mold assembly. The gas flow will result in a gentle dehydration of the CMC-hydrogel layer. The drying speed can be adjusted to prevent or reduce gas enclosures (e.g., air bubbles) in the solid CMC product. The humid air over the layer can be dried over desiccant (e.g., an air dryer or dehumidifier), temperature adjusted, and returned over the hydrogel again by the speed-controlled fan. A hygrometer can be positioned on the humid side of the chamber to provide an indication of the status of the drying process. After a predetermined dryness has been achieved, as indicated by the hygrometer, the drying process can be ended. 

[0246] Airflow can be adjusted to affect the drying speed. In the exemplary embodiment, the airflow is controlled to be between about 0.1-2.0 m/sec; the temperature is between ambient and about 50 degrees Celsius. Using these configurations, the drying time of a single layer CMC-hydrogel can be about 0.5-4 hours depend on the airflow and the set temperature. 

[0247] The pure CMC based product can be transparent, light off white, or amber colored. Its specific gravity can be about 1.55-1.58 g/ml. The product is desirably free of micro-bubbles and otherwise suitable for fabricating micron scale objects. The physical characterization of the final block/sheet product (hardness, tensile strength, etc.) can vary, but should generally be able to resist physical stresses associated with micromilling 

[0248] As described above, the microneedle arrays disclosed herein are capable of providing reliable and accurate delivery methods for various bioactive components. The structural, manufacturing, and distribution advantages characteristic of the above-described microneedle arrays can be particularly applicable for use in delivering vaccines. Advantages of these microneedle arrays include (1) safety, obviating the use of needles or living vectors for vaccine delivery, (2) economy, due to inexpensive production, product stability, and ease of distribution, and 3) diversity, via a delivery platform compatible with diverse antigen and adjuvant formulations. 

[0249] Moreover, cutaneous immunization by microneedle array has important advantages in immunogenicity. The skin is rich in readily accessible dendritic cells (DCs), and has long been regarded as a highly immunogenic target for vaccine delivery. These dendritic cell populations constitute the most powerful antigen presenting cells (APCs) identified thus far. For example, genetic immunization of skin results in transfection and activation of dendritic cells in murine and human skin, and these transfected dendritic cells synthesize transgenic antigens, migrate to skin draining lymph nodes, and efficiently present them through the MHC class I restricted pathway to stimulate CD8+ T-cells. The immune responses induced by skin derived DCs are remarkably potent and long-lasting compared to those induced by other immunization approaches. Recent clinical studies demonstrate that even conventional vaccines are significantly more potent when delivered intradermally, rather than by standard intramuscular needle injection. Thus, microneedle arrays can efficiently and simultaneously deliver both antigens and adjuvants, enabling both the targeting of DCs and adjuvant engineering of the immune response using the same delivery platform. 

[0250] High Frequency Electro-Magnetic Oscillating Applicator 

[0251] Microneedle array devices can be applied to human skin by a variety of methods including self or assisted application by human pressure (e.g., pushing with a finger or thumb), or with spring-loaded devices. To facilitate the ease and reproducibility of delivery of microneedle array devices, including tip-loaded microneedle arrays, an applicator device is described herein. The applicator device is configured to convert high frequency electromagnetic oscillation into unidirectional mechanical resonance of the active head. This in turn enables multiple reproducible low amplitude and high frequency pressure strokes that facilitate insertion of the microneedles of microneedle arrays into tissues including human skin. 

[0252] As shown in FIG. 38, the applicator can comprise an applicator head, an oscillator-energy converter, an electro-magnetic oscillator, and a power source. If desired, one, or all of these four elements can be detachable from the applicator device. 

[0253] An applicator head can be interchangeable to accommodate and act on different sized and shaped tissue surface areas. As shown in FIG. 39, various applicator head geometries can be utilized in combination with the applicator described herein. Applicator heads are interchangeable made of stainless steel or other chemically and physically resistant materials. If desired, the applicator heads can be autoclaved for sterility and/or sterilized by alcohols or other chemicals. Alternatively, or in addition, gas sterilization (ethylene oxide) is possible. 

[0254] Application specific geometries can be rapidly designed and fabricated. For example, the area of a single application in this example can range from 5 mm.sup.2 to 250 mm.sup.2 dependent on the active head's geometry. A broader range can be achieved by simple structural variation of the head's geometry. 

[0255] The oscillator energy converter unit can be configured to transforms the electro-magnetic oscillation into mechanical movements of the applicator head. The amplitude of the applicator head's in direction Z can be controlled between 0.5-2.5 mm (FIG. 40; A). In some embodiments, head movements in direction X-Y can be configured to be negligible, <0.2 mm (FIG. 40; B). The frequency of the mechanical movements resulting from the energy conversion in the direction Z can be controlled between 500-25000 rpm. If desired, the oscillator energy converter unit can be detachable and can be disposed or sterilized as needed. 

[0256] The electro-magnetic (EM) oscillator can be composed of three subunits. These subunits can include a (1) regulated power supply generating the voltage and power for the controller and high frequency EM oscillator; a (2) controller-regulator generates the high frequency signal and the required current for the EM oscillator; and (3) an EM oscillator. The output frequency can be controlled by the user (e.g., in ranges such as from 100-500 Hz). In some embodiments, the EM oscillator can be fully enclosed and can be sterilized by alcohol solutions or other chemical agents.

[0257] The power source unit can also be detachable to accommodate different attachable power sources such as: 

[0258] a. Battery, regular disposable alkaline or any other type. 

[0259] b. Rechargeable NiCad or Li oxide battery with built in inductive charger. 

[0260] c. Electronic power adapter to 100-240 V 

[0261] The applicator can provide several benefits in connection with microneedle array application. For example, the applicator can minimalize the mechanical force needed for microneedle array insertion into tissues. The applicator can also reduce pain effects compared to existing spring-loaded applicators. In addition, the applicator can be portable and the components of the applicator can be detachable and interchangeable. Finally, the applicator can be configured so that it is capable of being sterilized for aseptic use. 

[0262] In view of the many possible embodiments to which the principles of the disclosed embodiments may be applied, it should be recognized that the illustrated embodiments are only preferred examples and should not be taken as limiting the scope of protection. Rather, the scope of the protection is defined by the following claims. We therefore claim all that comes within the scope and spirit of these claims.

FABRICATION, METHODS, APPARATUSES, AND SYSTEMS FOR ULTRA-COMPLIANT PROBES FOR NEURAL AND OTHER TISSUES 

Abstract
Methods, systems and apparatuses of ultra-miniature, ultra-compliant probe arrays that allows for design flexibility to match the stiffness of the tissue it is being applied to, such as the brain tissue, in all three axes (x, y and z), with interconnect cross section smaller than cell dimensions. Stiffness matching requires specific geometric and fabrication approaches, commonly leading to ultra-thin probe wires. Sizing of the electrodes for specific cell dimensions reduces glial formation. Further reduction in stiffness is obtained by incorporating different geometric features to the electrode, such as meandering the electrode wires. The small thickness and geometric features of the wires commonly result in very high compliance. To enable effective insertion of the probes to the tissue, the present invention uses stiff biodisolvable and/or biodegradable polymers, including single use or combinations of carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, maltose, other sugar molecules, polylactic acid and its co-polymers.

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS 

[0001] The present invention is a Divisional Application of U. S. Non-Provisional application Ser. No. 13/680,794, filed Nov. 19, 2012 which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application 61/629,373, filed Nov. 17, 2011, all of which are incorporated by reference herein. 

FIELD OF THE INVENTION 

[0003] This invention relates to flexible electrodes and electrode arrays, and in particular to flexible electrode arrays that are useful for neural stimulation and recording, and methods of manufacturing the same. The present invention also covers the flexible electrodes and electrode arrays that could be used for applications in any human and animal tissues for the purpose of recording electrical signals or applying electrical stimulation. More particularly, the present invention describes high-compliance probes and their application for stimulation and recording from neural and other body tissues, and methods for manufacturing same. A specific aspect of the invention is the use of dissolvable, biodegradable, and biocompatible needles that encase the electrodes and facilitate their delivery into tissue. 

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 

[0004] Research on neural-machine interfaces (NMI) in recent years has demonstrated the feasibility of driving motor prosthesis for the upper limbs. Neural interface reliability has been identified as a critical research area where progress is needed prior to transitioning NMI technology for practical restoration of motor function in humans. Two key issues are 1) the inability of current interfaces to reliably obtain accurate information from neurons over a period of decades, and 2) currently measured neural signals cannot be reliably used to control prostheses with high speed and resolution. 

[0005] Neural probe hardware implanted in the brain tissue is a critical element in achieving these reliability goals. Failure of neural probes may be caused by several issues. After implantation, current probes are surrounded by reactive microglia and reactive astrocyte scarring as shown pictorially in FIG. 1A. Tissue reaction with the probe results in encapsulation that insulates the electrode by impeding diffusion and may impede current flow. Encapsulation increases the distance of the electrode from active neurons. For viable recording, the distance of the electrode from active neurons must be less than 100 .mu.m. Progressive death and degeneration of neurons in the zone around the inserted probe due to chronic inflammation may eliminate neural electrophysiological activity. Lastly, interconnects may fatigue and break due to stresses. Experiments in animals have resulted in some neural electrode sites failing while others keep working for several years. This variability in outcome is believed to be due to several factors including variable blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage, variable scar formation, mechanical strain from micromotion, inflammation, microglial condition and disconnected neurons. 

[0006] Neural probes employed today for neural-machine interface studies are essentially stiff needles usually made from wires, silicon or glass. Metal wire neural probes are typically 50-100 .mu.m in diameter and usually made of platinum or iridium and insulated with glass, Teflon, polyimide or parylene. Basic tests were performed in 1974 determining that iridium, rhodium, platinum and palladium, in that order, have excellent resistance to electrolysis under conditions simulating biostimulation applications Iridium appears best and microelectrodes should exhibit lifetimes against electrolysis of decades. 2D arrays of wire probes have been made for chronic implantation. Drawbacks of this approach are the manual assembly, the lack of multiple electrodes per shaft, and issues with the predominantly metal wire splaying when inserted in the tissue. FIG. 1B is a predicted outcome with the miniature, ultra-compliant probe according to the present invention. 

[0007] Silicon probes made with MEMS fabrication were first introduced by Ken Wise and Jim Angell at Stanford in 1969. Ken Wise's group at the University of Michigan subsequently developed a series of silicon probes and probe arrays with multi-site electrodes. The Michigan probes are made through a wet etch step that stops on boron-doped Si and necks the shank thickness down to around 15 .mu.m. In more recent work, Si Deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE) has been used to make Si probes without the boron etch stop. 

[0008] A 2D probe array was developed at the University of Utah in 1991, known as the Utah Electrode Array (UEA). The shanks in the UEA are made by sawing grooves into the substrate followed by a silicon wet etch to smooth the sidewalls and sharpen the needles. Platinum is deposited on the needles, which are subsequently coated in polyimide with just the tip exposed. Iridium has also been used for metallization. The UEA has been demonstrated repeatedly to record chronically, has recording sites 50 to 100 .mu.m long, suggesting to some researchers that large recording site sizes perform better for chronic recording. 

[0009] Polycrystalline diamond (poly-C) probes with 3 .mu.m thick undoped poly-C on a .about.1 .mu.m SiO.sub.2 layer have been fabricated by Dr. Aslam's group at Michigan State University. These probes, 5 mm long, are capable of electrical and electrochemical recording with AgCl reference electrodes, Au counter electrodes and doped poly-C working electrodes. 

[0010] Research groups have created more compliant probes made with thin-film wiring embedded in polymer insulating films. Flexible central nervous system (CNS) probes have been made in polyimide, SU8/parylene and all parylene. However, flexible probes for single-unit detection have had to maintain adequate stiffness for insertion into the brain tissue. Thus, all prior art probes are made with a straight shank and relatively large probe diameters. The result is that even the most advanced of today's probes are extremely stiff in both axial and transverse directions relative to brain tissue, which has a Young's modulus of approximately 30 kPa. Any axial force transmitted through the external cabling directly acts on the probe and creates shear forces at the electrode-tissue interfaces. Such forces may come from external motion or from tissue growth around the implant. A team from Drexel Univ., the Univ. of Kentucky and SUNY created ceramic-based multisite microelectrode arrays on alumina substrates with thickness ranging from 38 to 50 .mu.m, platinum recording sites of 22 .mu.m.times.80 .mu.m, and insulation using 0.1 .mu.m ion-beam assisted deposition of alumina. The 7 mm-long shanks widen to 700 .mu.m at the base. Their experience has shown that if the electrode is implanted slowly, there is a greater likelihood of recording a single neuron and when implanted quickly single units could not be recorded. After 3 months, there were no clear single neuron recordings from any recording sites and subsequent immunohistology showed glial formation for several hundred microns beyond the insertion hole. 

[0011] Y.-C. Tai's group at Caltech produced parylene-coated silicon probes with integral parylene cabling, shown in FIG. 2A. The shanks were up to 12 mm long. Parylene adhesion to silicon was enhanced by performing a short XeF.sub.2 etch to roughen the substrate. A primary innovation was a flexible 10 .mu.m-thick, 830 .mu.m-wide, 2.5 mm-long parylene cable. Sacrificial photoresist was placed under the cable as a release layer. Backside Si DRIE was used to free the device from the rest of the substrate. A 200.degree. C. anneal for 48 hr was performed to soften and allow straightening of the meanders in the cabling from the compact planar layout. 16-channel Omnetics connectors were bonded with conductive epoxy in through-holes on the parylene and backed with a printed circuit board for mechanical strength. 

[0012] Flexible polyimide probe arrays (FIG. 2C) have been made with gold electrodes. These probes must be inserted by first creating an insertion hole with a scalpel or needle. A later polyimide probe array incorporated silicon for selected locations along the length of the shank, with polyimide connectors to create enhanced compliance, as shown in FIG. 2B. 

[0013] FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrated an all-polymer probe design incorporated a lateral lattice-like parylene structure attached to a larger SU8 shank to reduce the structural size close to the electrodes. The lattice structure, shown in FIG. 3A, included a 4 .mu.m-wide, 5 .mu.m-thick lateral beam (See FIG. 3D) located parallel to the main shank. Encapsulating cell density around the lateral beam was reduced by one-third relative to the larger shank. SU8 shank can be coated with a parylene coating forming a coated shank having a depth of 48 .mu.m. 

[0014] Flexible probes have been made in all parylene with 0.5 .mu.m-thick gold interconnect and electrodes. The parylene cross-sectional dimension was set at 100 .mu.m wide and 25 .mu.m thick to create adequate stiffness for insertion. Probes up to 2.5 mm long, shown in FIG. 2D, were designed but insertion was performed to 0.5 mm. The probe retained mechanical and electrical integrity following acute tests in rats after controlled cortical impact with a 2 mm stroke. Researchers at IMTEK created ultra compliant ECoG probes on a polyimide/platinum foil substrate. The 252-channel array spanning 35 mm by 60 mm was made by spinning two 5 mm-thick polyimide films onto a silicon substrate. The first polyimide film was roughened by O.sub.2 plasma to enhance adhesion of the direct sputtered 300 nm-thick platinum interconnect layer. Tweezers were used to pull the finished array from the wafer. Omnetics connectors were electrically bonded to through-holes in the film with solder paste and mechanically fixed with epoxy. QuinetiQ is developing liquid crystal polymer neural probes and cables. Rogers' group at UIUC has developed implantable electrodes using transfer of silicon parts onto bioresorbable silk with a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp process. This approach will prove useful for ECoG electrodes as well. 

[0015] U.S. patent application Ser. No. 20090099441 from Dr. Giszter's Drexel group describes biodegradable stiffening wires 1 braided with electrode wires 2 with electrodes 3 (see FIG. 3C) where flexible wires 2 are braided onto a large diameter, stiff maypole structure 4 with stiff biodegradable strands 1. When the biodegradable strands 1 dissolve, the flexible wiring 2 is left in the brain tissue. Reliable and manufacturable connections to the braided wires become difficult when scaled to arrays. 

[0016] Olbricht et al has reported on flexible microfluidic devices supported by biodegradable insertion scaffolds for convection-enhanced neural drug delivery. The device consists of a flexible parylene-C microfluidic channel that is supported during its insertion into tissue by a biodegradable poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) scaffold. The scaffold is made separately by hot embossing the PLGA material into a mold. The parylene-C microfluidic channel is then manually assembled by first tacking it down to the scaffold with a drop of epoxy followed by a dip in dichloromethane to partly dissolve some of the PLGA and thereby attach it to the parylene-C shank. The PLGA shanks were nearly 100% degraded after 27 days in organic chemical buffering agent and were compliant after 15 to 18 days. 

[0017] Suzuki, Mabuchi et al, describe multichannel flexible neural probes coated with PLGA microspheres that were infused with nerve growth factor. Two types of neural probes were created. Both probe types included flexible thin-film parylene-C probes. The first probe (type-A) included a parylene-C groove along the shank for manual placement of PLGA microspheres mixed with polyethylene glycol. The second probe (type-B) included multiple electrodes without the groove structure. The PLGA was manually coated to create the biodegradable shank for insertion. Both probes were inserted in a rat cortex, with successful neural recording from the type-A probe. Neural signals were not observed from the type-B probe, presumably due to residual PLGA obstructing the electrode. 

[0018] Tyler et al, have developed a neural probe made from a polymer nanocomposite of poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) and tunicate whiskers, inspired by the sea cucumber dermis. The probe material exhibits a real part of the elastic modulus (tensile storage modulus) of 5 GPa after fabrication. When exposed to physiological fluid conditions, its modulus decreases to 12MPa. The probe did not include wiring. Results from animal implantation studies showed an increased neuronal density and decreased glial formation around the PVAc probe when compared to a 50 .mu.m-diameter tungsten wire probe. This work provides evidence that mechanical flexibility of the probe is an important aspect of reliable neural probes. 

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 

[0019] This present invention describes methods, systems and apparatuses of ultra-miniature, ultra-compliant probe arrays, and associated biodissolvable and/or biodegradable delivery vehicles. Although the present invention finds applications in many human and animal tissue systems, as a specific focus and example, the application of ultra-compliant probes and probe arrays to intracortical neural probing is described here. The probe array allows design flexibility to match the stiffness of the tissue it is being applied to, such as the brain tissue, in all three axes (x, y and z), with interconnect cross section (thickness and width) smaller than cell dimensions (<10.mu.m). This stiffness matching requires specific geometric and fabrication approaches, commonly leading to ultra-thin probe wires. This invention also allows the sizing of the electrodes for specific cell dimensions, e.g., to reduce glial scar formation. Further enhancement of compliance is obtained by incorporating different geometric features to the electrode, such as meandering the electrode wires. The small thickness and geometric features of the wires commonly result in very high compliance (as required). Under these circumstances, to enable effective insertion of the probes to the tissue (e.g., brain), the present invention uses stiff biodisolvable and/or biodegradable polymers, including (but not limited to) single use or combinations of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), maltose, other sugar molecules, polylactic acid (PLA) and its co-polymers. Furthermore and importantly, drugs, such as dexamethasone, and other biologics can be embedded into the biodegradable polymers to realize effects, such as anti-inflammation, during the application. 

[0020] Distinguishing features of the present invention are (1) the use of specific electrode thickness (thin electrodes) that are sized for particular tissues and cells, as well as for tailored compliance, (2) the use of specific electrode geometries, such as meandered electrodes, to further increase the compliance in the axial and lateral directions, (3) the use of biodegradable and/or bio-dissolvable polymers (e.g., CMC) that create a stiff enclosure to the electrodes, thereby facilitating their reliable insertion; as well as reducing or eliminating permanent tissue damage by rapidly dissolving, (4) specific geometric features on the polymer needles that enable reduced tissue damage (e.g., micro-scale dimensions), easier insertion (e.g., sharp edges), retention (e.g., negative angles or undercuts), and mechanical stability (e.g., fillets), (5) capability to incorporate additional bio-agents and drugs into the needle material to enable specific biological response (e.g., dexamethasone to reduce inflammation), and (6) the ability to batch fabricate the probes with planar processing, making the probes less expensive and more repeatable, especially when scaled to multi-site multi-probe arrays. 

[0021] Many other applications of electrodes and electrode arrays for providing stimulation and gathering electrical signals (e.g., to/from cardiac tissue, muscle tissues, etc.) have been considered. Those applications will also benefit from specifically sized (with respect to the cell dimensions) and compliance matched electrodes and electrode arrays that will provide minimal-to-no tissue damage, longevity, and reliability: they are also covered in this invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 

[0039] This present invention describes methods, systems and apparatuses of ultra-miniature, ultra-compliant probe arrays. Although the present invention finds applications in many human and animal tissue systems, as a specific focus and example, the application of ultra-compliant probes and probe arrays to intracortical neural probing is described here. The probe array allows design flexibility to match the stiffness of the tissue it is being applied to, such as the brain tissue, in all three axes (x, y and z), with interconnect cross section smaller than cell dimensions (<10.mu.m). This stiffness matching requires specific geometric and fabrication approaches, commonly leading to ultra-thin wires. This invention also allows the sizing of the electrodes for specific cell dimensions, e.g., to reduce glial scar formation. Further enhancement in compliance is obtained by incorporating different geometric features to the electrode, such as meandering the electrode wires. The small thickness and geometric features of the wires commonly result in very low stiffness (as required). Under these circumstances, to enable effective insertion of the probes to the tissue (e.g., brain), the present invention uses stiff bio-disolvable and/or biodegradable polymers, including (but not limited to) single use or combinations of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyvinyl alcohol (PLA) and its co-polymers. The descriptions below consider specifically CMC as the material of choice, but the invention is not limited to the use of CMC, but covers the use of any bio-dissolvable and bio-degradable polymer that encases the electrodes to facilitate the insertion. Furthermore, the invention covers different geometries of the polymer (insertion) needles, such as sharp tips, serrated edges, fillets (for increased mechanical stability), to name a few. 

[0040] The concept of the probe array of the present invention 10 is illustrated in FIGS. 4A-C. The probes 10 are made from thin-film meandered platinum wiring surrounded by parylene-C (other polymers may be used). In contrast to prior flexible probes, the meandered wiring is compliant in the axial direction as well as in lateral directions. Wiring continues onto an integral parylene cable 12 to move connections away from the probe. The parylene cable 12 is designed to allow suturing or other attachment to the dura (or to the skin in the acute tests on small animals). 

[0041] A schematic plan view of an envisioned probe array and cabling design is shown in FIG. 6. Wiring 14 coming out from the electrodes 16 is routed to the side to lie down naturally onto tissue. The individual parylene micro-cables 12 gradually widen from 7 .mu.m (location A) to 40 .mu.m (location B) while meandering to decouple stress from the main cable 18. After 5 mm, the wiring 14 is mechanically brought together onto a single integral parylene cable 18 that will span up to 10 cm. The wiring 14 is routed to a set of through-hole pads 20 with layout geometry that matches male connectors (not shown) used in neural recording hardware, such as Omnetics Nano NPD. A carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), which is a fast degrading, non-cross-linked natural polymer, tab 22 is included to provide an attachment region for the stereotaxis micromanipulator that is used to manually insert electrodes into animals for the in vivo use. This technique provides a controlled and repeatable insertion for single probes and 1D array probes. The present invention is not restricted to the particular dimensions described. A multitude of designs with wiring of different length, width, thickness and orientation, with electrodes of different numbers, size and location, and with needle arrays of different numbers, size and shape. One embodiment of tab 22 includes two sections: a first section 22A that is thicker than a second section 22B such that the second section 22B dissolves before the first section 22A. One or more needle molds 24 are attached to the second section 22B. The probe wiring 14 is encased in the needle mold 24 of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Use of blends of CMC with other biodegradable polymers, such as sucrose, glucose, maltodextrin, and poly(vinylpyrrolidone, PVP), is also possible to tune stiffness properties. The biodegradable needle temporarily supplies the necessary strength for insertion. Probe length 26 is dictated by the desire to place electrodes within the 1-3 mm thick grey matter 28 (see FIG. 4A) in the gyri 30, but to also access grey matter within the sulci folds 32 on the sides where large densities of motor neurons are located. The folds are up to 8 mm deep (e.g. in primates) and set an upper design limit on the probe length for most neural studies. Other probe lengths are possible and may be appropriate for deep brain stimulation, for example. FIG. 7A is an illustration of probe 10 having meandering wires 14 in each needle 24, wherein the meandering wires 14 are shown continuing into second section 22B of tab 22. 

[0042] Sodium salt of carboxymethyl cellulose is categorized by the FDA as a "generally recognized as safe" substance. It has been used as replacement of silicon-based breast implants for over fifteen years and is being researched in direct contact with deep tissues for bone replacement/repair. CMC-alginate mixture-based injectable gels are currently being tested for the in situ formation of scaffolding for repairing CNS damage. 

[0043] CMC has several distinct advantages over other bio-degradable polymers, including (1) room-temperature preparation, which enables embedding bio-active agents directly into the material, (2) hydro-gel formability, which facilitates molding and spin-casting fabrication, (3) high strength and stiffness, providing required resistance for insertion application, (4) rapid bio-absorbability (dissolution), and (5) no harmful by-products from in vivo degradation. In contrast, PLA and PLGA require high-temperature preparation, and leave acidic by-products that prevent its usage for the needle application. However, depending on the specific tissue application, other biodegradable and dissolvable polymers may be utilized. 

[0044] The effective stiffness of the CMC-encased probes depends not only on the mechanical properties of the CMC, but also the geometry of the needles. The fabrication conditions of the CMC, including viscosity of the initial hydrogel, molecular weight of the particular sodium-CMC used for fabrication, drying rate, and centrifuge conditions (for spin-casting) must be carefully controlled. Elastic modulus values between 0.7 GPa and 3 GPa can be expected, with tensile strength values between 14 MPa and 100 MPa. Given a set of material properties, the stiffness and effective strength of the needles depends on the needle geometry. Higher aspect ratios (length per diameter) will result in lower strength values. CMC can be blended with other biodegradable polymers to set particular stiffness and molding properties. 

[0045] To obtain required strength and resistance to buckling and fracture during tissue insertion, the cross-sectional area in initial embodiments of the probes are approximately 100 .mu.m.times.100 .mu.m or 300 .mu.m.times.100 .mu.m. A small cross-section is desirable to limit damage to tissue upon insertion. The choice of cross-sectional area is dependent on adequate stiffness for insertion into tissue and probe length must be taken into account. Buckling can be predicted based on the end conditions and needle geometry and materials. Furthermore, enhancements to stiffness and factor-of-safety against failure can be attained in some embodiments by modifying the needle design (e.g., an I-beam design) without an increase in the cross-sectional area. The other factor affecting buckling is the maximum force required for the needle to penetrate the tissue. In some embodiments this is controlled by the needle design. The in-plane dimensions and shape are determined by the designed layout of the needle with one-to-one correspondence so characteristics like the radius of the needle tip and the tip angle can be modified to reduce the maximum force on the needle shaft during insertion. In other embodiments, the phenomenon of aspect ratio dependent etching (ARDE) allows control of the out-of-plane shape and dimension of the needle through the use of sacrificial patterns applied during the formation of the needle mold. 

[0046] The strength against failure also depends on the stress concentrations. The inclusion of stress-concentration reducing features such as fillets can increase the strength of needles against fracture by an order of magnitude. Examples of micromolded CMC needles made by the inventors are shown in FIGS. 5A-E. The needles show a large amount of dissolution after insertion into human skin explants for 20 minutes (FIG. 5C and E). 

[0047] In some embodiments of the present invention, micro-molecules, macro-molecules, and/or particulates can be integrated into the dissolvable polymers (e.g., CMC) to provide additional functionalities or properties. For example, to mitigate the potential inflammatory response due to the insertion of the probes into the CNS, an anti-inflammatory drug, such as dexamethasone sodium phosphate, can be incorporated into CMC. 

[0048] As another example, other biodegradable and/or non-degradable polymers can be added to the biodegradable polymer base to control/select the mechanical properties (stiffness, strength, etc.) and bio-degradability (dissolution rate) of the probe enclosures. For CMC base, some examples of added polymers include, but are not limited to, PVP, PVA, PLA, PLGA, and PCL. Furthermore, other complex sugars, such as maltose, dextrose, etc., can be added to the CMC matrix to control the needle characteristics. CMC's with different density can be mixed to attain improved dissolution properties. Further, deliberate porosity may be incorporated into CMC needles to accelerate dissolution rate. 

[0049] Platinum provides low resistance interconnect, it is biocompatible, and it is widely used in neural probe electrodes. The conformal and inert nature of parylene-C is effective in sealing and insulating implantable electronics and wiring for short-term and medium-term use. Hermetic sealing layers, such as alumina or silicon carbide, are deemed important for long-term use. Ideally, the cross-section of the individual wires should be less than the surrounding neural cells; we are targeting an interconnect width including insulation layers of around 7 .mu.m, which is a practical lower limit set by conventional contact photolithography. Smaller wiring width is possible with advanced lithography. Wiring becomes wider when brought onto the integral parylene cabling. The resulting wire resistance is on the order of 100.OMEGA. for a 1.5 mm probe. 

[0050] Now turning to FIG. 9B, a meander amplitude of 50 .mu.m (i.e. the width of the meander pattern measured from its axis) results in axial compliance that is less than the tissue and will decouple external probe stress from the electrodes. In one embodiment, the meander is formed from circular arcs, which have lower stress concentrations than other curved shapes of similar amplitude and pitch leading to a design that is fundamentally more robust mechanically and less prone to fatigue failure modes during the continuous mechanical cycling characteristic of pulsatile and respiratory brain micromotion. Since the compliance in the lateral directions is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the axial compliance, this amount of meandering may not be necessary, but underscores that there is plenty of room in the fabrication method to match the mechanical impedance of brain tissue. Many other designs of meandering geometries and sizes are possible. For example, meander designs can be zig-zag (triangular-wave) shaped, square-wave shaped, or many other periodic or aperiodic shape. Corners of the meanders can be rounded with various radius values. A probe of such large axial compliance could never be inserted without a stiff needle connected mechanically in parallel. Our biodegradable needle solution is effective for this purpose. 

[0051] In one embodiment of the present invention, as shown in FIG. 7B, sidewall barbs 34 are cast into the CMC needle 24 to keep the needle 24 inserted in the tissue. Parylene tethers 36 hold the wiring 14 in place during the CMC molding (see FIGS. 9A-9C). Necking regions 38 of the tethers 36 (see FIG. 9C) will aid in breaking. The wiring 14 meanders as shown have an amplitude of about 25 .mu.m. These meanders provide the low axial and lateral compliance that is unique to our design. Now turning to FIGS. 9A-C illustrating an embodiment for 4.5 .mu.m-thick, 7 .mu.m-wide, 1.5 mm long parylene electrode wiring 14 with 50 .mu.m amplitude and 200 .mu.m pitch meanders and assuming E=2.76 GPa, the axial spring constant is 0.35 N/m and lateral spring constants are below 1.1 mN/m. The equivalent reaction stiffness of the brain tissue (E=30 kPa) is estimated to be 0.94 N/m in the axial direction; i.e. the probes 10 are more compliant than brain tissue. FIG. 7C illustrates a magnified view of needle tip 24A showing electrode 16 and tethers 36. 

[0052] The probe wiring 14, tethers 36, tether necking regions 38 and electrodes 16 will be made using planar fabrication on silicon wafers or substrates. Embodiments of the planar process flow used in fabrication of the probes 10 according to the present invention are shown in FIGS. 8A-8Z and is described in flow chart form in FIGS. 13A-C. FIG. 8A illustrates the lower layer of insulation 38 is deposited on a substrate 39 that enables handling and manipulation during fabrication. The insulation 38 can be deposited in blanket form and patterned photolithographically, or it can be directly deposited in a pattern using techniques like 3D printing. In one embodiment, the insulation 38 is parylene-C, but could be replaced by other organic and inorganic insulating materials, like PDMS or alumina, respectively. Adhesion of parylene to the substrate may be enhanced by XeF.sub.2 etch roughening of the substrate prior to deposition. The minimum thickness of the insulation 38 depends on the quality of the deposited film, and the film type, but could be as thin 100 nm. The maximum thickness is determined by the size of the cells of the tissue into which the device is being implanted. For neural tissue, where cells are on the order of 20 .mu.m, the limit on thickness for this insulation layer 38 is 10 .mu.m. FIG. 8B illustrates the conducting material 40 that will be patterned to form the electrode 16 and its wire interconnect is deposited on top of the insulator 38. In one embodiment, the conducting material layer 40 is Pt with a thickness of 500 nm. Platinum can be deposited directly onto polyimide with O.sub.2 plasma roughening. This same procedure may be useful for direct adhesion to parylene. The lower limit on thickness of conducting material 40 depends on the resistivity of the material and its film quality, while the upper limit on its thickness is dependent on the thickness of the insulation layers 38, 42 (see FIG. 8E) because the overall thickness must be less than the size of the cells of the tissue into which the probe 10 is being implanted. It is possible for the film to range in thickness from 100 nm to 19 .mu.m, depending on the thickness of the insulation 38. 

[0053] FIG. 8C illustrates that the layout pattern of the wire 14 and the electrode 16 are photolithographically printed in photoresist 41 on the outer surface 40A of the conducting material 40. The patterned photoresist 41 is used as a mask to prevent removal of the conducting material 40 under the photoresist 41 during a selective conducting material 40 removal process shown in FIG. 8D. The photoresist 41 thickness in all cases, is dependent on the thickness of the metal used for the conducting material 40 and the size of the feature to be patterned; however, the typical thickness ranges from 200 nm to 20 .mu.m. The removal process can be performed using wet chemicals, or plasmas, depending on the conducting material 40. Following the selective conducting material 40 removal process, the photoresist 41 is removed from the surface of the substrate 39 and the substrate 39 is cleaned in preparation for subsequent depositions as shown in FIG. 8E. After cleaning, a second insulator layer 42 is deposited over the first insulator layer 38 and the patterned conductor 40 as shown in FIG. 8F. The thickness of this layer must not exceed the value that would make the total structure thickness exceed the cellular dimensions. The minimum layer thickness depends on the material choice and the minimum thickness required to ensure electrical insulation. 

[0054] FIG. 8G illustrates that the insulated wire pattern is photolithographically formed in photoresist 43 on the surface of the upper insulator layer 42. A selective insulator layers 38, 42 removal process shown in FIG. 8H is applied to transfer the insulator pattern into the insulator layers 38, 42. Following the transfer process, the photoresist 43 is removed and the surfaces are cleaned as shown in FIG. 8I. FIG. 8J illustrates a hard mask material 44 is deposited on the top surface of the substrate 39, and the patterned insulator layers with embedded conductor. The material is called hard because of its increased resistance to processes that selectively remove the substrate material and its inorganic composition. Typical hardmask materials are metals, like Al and Cr. The minimum hardmask thickness is determined by the depth of substrate 39 that must be removed and the selectivity of the removal process to the hardmask materials. The minimum thickness of hardmask 44 is typically selected and this is around 100 nm for Al. FIG. 8K illustrates patterning of photoresist 45 with bottom mold pattern on the hardmask 44. FIG. 8L illustrates selective removal of hardmask layer 44 to transfer bottom mold pattern from photoresist 43. FIGS. 8M illustrates removal of photoresist 45 and cleaning of surfaces. In one embodiment of the invention the substrate 39 is Si and is selectively removed using a process called Deep Reactive Ion Etch (DRIE) which etches Si only in a vertical direction as shown in FIG. 8N. The depth of the DRIE Si etch is driven by the desired dimensions of the encasement. In one embodiment, the depth of this part of the process is about 40 .mu.m. Following DRIE, columns of substrate 38 remain under the insulated wire pattern and electrodes 40. In FIGS. 8O illustrates the wire pattern and electrodes 40 being suspended when these regions of substrate 38 are removed using a process that removes material in all directions at the same rate. This isotropic process is performed until there is no Si left under the wires and electrodes 40 and is performed for a length of time dependent on the rate at which Si etches and the width of the wires and electrodes. The depth of the bottom mold is dependent on the desired thickness of the final encasement. In one embodiment the depth of the bottom mold is 60 .mu.m, but could range from 5 .mu.m to 100 .mu.m depending on the desired needle thickness and the desired position of the wire and electrode within the needle. In one embodiment of the present invention, both the top and bottom of the platinum are clad in Ti or TiN to ensure adhesion on both sides. In this case, the platinum electrode would conveniently become exposed during the Si DRIE step illustrated in FIG. 8I, which will also directionally etch Ti. An overlap of parylene around the exposed electrode will be designed to help "lock in" the electrode 16 and prevent stress-induced etching of the metal-parylene interface. Following electrode formation, its recording and stimulating properties can be enhanced by applying materials such as PEDOT (Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)) that reduce the electrical impedance to neural signals. The deposition of materials that modify the electrode surface can be done in several ways, for example, electrochemically or by direct additive deposition using technologies like dip pen nanolithography. 

[0055] The silicon deep reactive-ion etch (DRIE) and isotropic etch steps are subject to ARDE effects that can be used to create three-dimensional structure in the needle mold. These effects, along with the layout pattern of meandering wires, tethers, tether necking regions and the outline of the needle, define the lower half of the needle shape. In the regions covered by the layout pattern the substrate is not removed until the final etching process shown in FIG. 8N and this results in a shallow 3D structure on the bottom surface of the bottom mold that corresponds to the meandering wires, tethers, and tether necking regions. 

[0056] The upper needle shape is set by a top mold 46 (see FIG. 8Q) with a shape defined by the outline of the needle, made from an elastomer, such as PDMS or PVS, a resin, such as UV-curable resins, or any other polymer or dissolvable materials. The top mold fabrication is described in FIGS. 16A-H and 17 and uses a technique referred to as the sandwich method. In Step 1 (FIG. 16A), a master mold that includes the needle shape is used. The master mold can be formed in several ways, for example from a PMMA master mold 202 made by mechanical micromilling or from a Si master mold made by patterning a Si substrate with the needle pattern and applying the process steps of Si Deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE) (FIG. 8N), Si isotropic etching (FIG. 8O), and wet strip aluminum mask 44 (FIG. 8P). The depth of the needle-shaped mold area is made to be the same as the target top-mold thickness. In Step 2 (FIG. 16B), an intermediate mold material 204, such as PDMS, is applied onto the master mold 202. In Step 3 (FIG. 16C), the intermediate mold material 204 is cured and separated from the master mold 202 to form intermediate mold 206. In Step 4 (FIG. 16D), the intermediate mold 206 is sandwiched between two glass slides 208, and appropriate force is used to hold the three pieces together. In Step 5 (FIG. 16E), the top mold material 210 is poured between the top glass slide 208 and the intermediate mold 206. In one embodiment, top mold material 210 is an elastomer such as PVS. In another embodiment, the top mold material 210 is a UV-curable resin. In Step 6 (FIG. 16F), the top mold material 210 is cured to form the top mold 46. For example, if UV-curable resin is used, UV rays are emitted from a UV-lamb is used to cure the top mold material 210. The top mold 46 is then separated from the glass slides 208 and the intermediate mold 206. In Step 7 (FIG. 16G), a precision assembly approach is used to assemble the top mold 46 onto the wired Si bottom mold 8A. In one embodiment, a device bonder is used for this assembly. Thus, in Step 8 (FIG. 16H) the assembled top-bottom mold 102 with wires is obtained, which will be subsequently used for spin-casting. 

[0057] Following completion of the bottom mold 8A, a top mold 46 is applied in one embodiment to form assembled mold 102 as shown in FIG. 8Q. In another embodiment, shown in FIG. 8W, the substrate is etched through so the bottom mold 51 is completely open. Several bottom molds 51 are stacked together as shown in FIG. 8X and the top mold 46 is applied to form a structure in which wires and electrodes are arrayed in a 3-dimensional matrix. FIG. 8Y is an illustration of the molds 46, 51 filled with a hydro-gel of CMC or other dissolvable substance by a process discussed in detail below to form probe 10 in FIG. 8Z. 

[0058] The hydro-gel of CMC 47 is poured into the PDMS-Si mold (FIG. 8R). A more detailed description of the spin-casting process is included in FIGS. 14A-H and 15. In Step 1 (FIG. 14A), the assembled mold 102 obtained from the sandwich molding is used. In Step 2 (FIG. 14B), a hydrogel 47 of the dissolvable (needle) material is applied on the assembled mold 102 to form hydrogel-dispensed assembled molds 106. In one embodiment, the dissolvable material is CMC, and the hydrogel 47 has 15% concentration of CMC and the rest is water. Other solvents can be used in the process based on the choice of dissolvable polymer. In Step 3 (FIG. 14C), a high-g laboratory centrifuge 108 is used to spin the hydrogel-dispensed assembled molds 106. The centrifuge 108 ensures removal of air pockets from the hydro-gel 47 and the complete filling of the mold 102. In one embodiment, the top of the top mold is completely exposed. In another embodiment, release holes (not shown) on top of the top mold 46 are used. Through the centrifuging, the water is evaporated in controlled low temperature, dry conditions, and the dissolvable needle material (e.g., CMC) 47 is solidified to form solidified layer 48. If needed, to ensure complete filing of the mold, considering the shrinkage of CMC, the application of additional layers of CMC 48 is repeated twice, or more times until the needle reaches the desired dry thickness (FIGS. 8S-8U). The final thickness depends on the required mechanical stiffness of the needle to ensure penetration of the tissue without breakage. In one embodiment, this thickness is 125 .mu.m but can range from 50 .mu.m to 200 .mu.m for insertion into dura-resected brain when the needle length is 1.5 mm. In Step 4 (FIG. 14D), the dried CMC 48 on the assembled mold is obtained. In Step 5 (FIG. 14E), a squeegee method is used to remove the excess CMC. In this method, a sharp blade with a soft coating (e.g., PDMS) is used, and a number of repeated steps of water application and squeegeeing followed until the excess material is completely removed, as shown in Step 5. Considerable shrinkage of the CMC during this process facilitates easy separation of CMC from the assembled mold 10, as seen in Step 6 (FIG. 14F). In Step 7 (FIG. 14G), a precision assembly approach is used to assemble the top mold 46 onto the wired Si bottom mold 8A. In one embodiment, a device bonder is used for this assembly. Thus, in Step 8 (FIG. 14H) the assembled top-bottom mold 102 with wires is obtained, which will be subsequently used for spin-casting. The batch fabrication allows multiple probe designs to be placed on a single mask set, or to fabricate multiple probes of the same design. FIG. 8V illustrates the final probe 10 after being removed from the molds. 

[0059] Now returning to FIGS. 13A-C that illustrate in process flow diagrams of an exemplary probe fabrication process of the present invention. The process includes many options: 

[0060] Step 1a or 1b: The insulator layer 38 can be formed on a substrate 39 by depositing (Step 1a) or by direct patterning (Step 1b); 

[0061] Next, all above steps continue to Steps 2-5: 

[0062] Step 2: Depositing of conductor 40 that becomes the electrode and wiring; 

[0063] Step 3: Patterning of photoresist 41 with electrode and wiring pattern; 

[0064] Step 4: Selective removal of conductor layer 40 to transfer electrode and wire pattern from photoresist 41; 

[0065] Step 5: Removal of photoresist 41 and cleaning of surfaces to prepare them for subsequent depositions; 

[0066] Next, after completion of all the above step the process continues to either Steps 6a-9 or Step 6b: The upper insulator layer 42 can be formed by either of the following steps: 

[0067] Option 1-Steps 6a-9: 

[0068] Step 6a: Deposition of upper insulator layer 42; 

[0069] Step 7: Patterning of photoresist 43 with insulator pattern; 

[0070] Step 8: Selective removal of all insulator layers 38 42 to transfer electrode and wire pattern from photoresist; and 

[0071] Step 9: Removal of photoresist 43 and cleaning of surfaces to prepare them for subsequent depositions. 

[0072] Option 2:-Step 6b 

[0073] Step 6b: Direct patterned deposition of upper insulator layer 42. 

[0074] Next, all above steps continue to Steps 10-14: 

[0075] Step 10: Deposition of hard mask layer 44; 

[0076] Step 11: Patterning of photoresist 45 with bottom mold pattern; 

[0077] Step 12: Selective removal of hard mask layer 44 to transfer bottom mold pattern from photoresist 43; 

[0078] Step 13: Removal of photoresist 43 and cleaning of surfaces; 

[0079] Step 14: Selective directional removal of the rigid substrate 39; 

[0080] Next, all the above steps will continue to either Step 15a or Step 15b: removal of rigid substrate 39 can be performed by Selective isotropic removal of the rigid substrate 39 for a single layer wire array by retaining bottom surface 39A (Step 15a) or selective isotropic removal of the rigid substrate 39 to form stackable bottom molds by removing bottom surface 39A (Step 15b); 

[0081] After completion of either Step 15a or Step 15b, the next process step is Step 16: Selective removal of the hard mask layer 44; 

[0082] Next, after the above step the process continues to either Step 17a-22a (single array of wires) or Step 17b-22b (stack or 3D multiple array of wires) 

[0083] Option 1: 

[0084] Step 17a: Placement of a top mold 46 patterned with the bottom mold pattern on top of the bottom mold; 

[0085] Step 18a: Application of polymer gel 47 to the assembled mold; 

[0086] Step 19a: Dry polymer 48 after water evaporation; 

[0087] Step 20a: Application of additional polymer gel 49 on top of original dried polymer 48; 

[0088] Step 21a: Dried polymer 50 filling the entire needle mold; 

[0089] Step 22a: Demolded polymer needle with encased wires and electrodes; 

[0090] Option 2: 

[0091] Step 18a: Stacking of multiple bottom molds 51 and placement of a top mold 46 patterned with the bottom mold pattern on top of the bottom molds; 

[0092] Step 18b: Application of multiple layers of polymer gel, followed by drying of the polymer performed until the mold is completely filled with dry polymer; 

[0093] Step 22b: Demolded polymer needle with encased stacked wires and electrodes; 

[0094] A detailed single-electrode probe layout with parylene tethers that hold the wiring in place during the CMC molding is shown in FIGS. 9A-C. In this particular embodiment, the meanders are set to 50 .mu.m amplitude and 200 .mu.m pitch. These meanders provide the axial compliance that is unique to the present invention. By including meanders, the lateral compliance is also enhanced when compared to a straight wire. For 4.5 .mu.m-thick, 7 .mu.m-wide, 1.5 mm long parylene electrode wiring with 50 .mu.m amplitude and 200 .mu.m pitch meanders, the axial spring constant is 0.35 N/m, assuming E=2.76 GPa. Lateral spring constants are below 1.1 mN/m. The platinum cross section is smaller (0.5 .mu.m-thick, 4 .mu.m-wide) and is for the moment neglected in this analysis. Assuming a Young's modulus of brain tissue of 30 kPa and a mechanical stress healing distance of 100 .mu.m from the wiring, the equivalent stiffness is estimated to be 0.94 N/m acting in the axial direction on the probe described above. Therefore the equivalent brain stiffness will be larger than that of probes with this sizing (i.e., the probes will be more compliant than the brain tissue). 

[0095] Multi-electrode probes will either require parylene-encased "wiring" that becomes wider as it nears the base of the shank or multiple parylene-encased wires to interconnect to multiple electrodes. Various designs are possible according to the present invention to achieve the desired compliance while being adequately tethered. Parylene is listed as a leading embodiment, but other material may be used to encase the wiring. 

[0096] The shank sidewall definition is set by the sacrificial metal mask layer. A Si etch process that etches all exposed horizontal and vertical Si surfaces at an equal rate, which is called isotropic etching, undercuts the parylene/platinum wiring, tethers and tether necking regions by proceeding for a sufficient time to laterally etch the Si from under the narrow features defined by the sacrificial metal mask, but not long enough to remove the Si from under the large areas of the sacrificial metal mask. The isotropic Si etch is followed by wet etch of the sacrificial metal mask. The neck-down region of the tethers is released after the metal mask etch step as indicated in FIG. 9C. The tethers are designed to break apart upon removal of the CMC shank from the substrate. 

[0097] The recording electrode size should be made as small as possible with a minimum target of 7 .mu.m set by conservative lithography and etch. The target impedance of the electrode-solution interface is 500 k.OMEGA. at 1 kHz. The calculated 110.OMEGA. resistance of the 4 .mu.m-wide wiring for a 1.5 mm probe is very small compared to the target electrode impedance. Even an 8 mm long probe will have resistance of only around 600.OMEGA.. Cable wiring will add to the overall device resistance but still be negligible compared to the interface resistance. 

[0098] Probes according to the present invention can be made spanning a large design space, including multi-site probes, multi-probe arrays, and different probe lengths, shank widths, shank shapes, wire widths, meander widths and electrode sizes. FIGS. 10A, 10B, 11, and 12A-B are illustrations of various examples of the present invention. 

[0099] Although the present invention has generally been described in terms of specific embodiments and implementations, the present invention is applicable to other methods, apparatuses, systems, and technologies. The examples provided herein are illustrative and not limiting, and other variations and modifications of the present invention are contemplated. Those and other variations and modifications of the present invention are possible and contemplated, and it is intended that the foregoing specification and the following claims cover such modifications and variations.

CLAIM OF PRIORITY 

[0001] This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. .sctn.119(e) to provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 61/959,662, filed Aug. 29, 2013, and provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 61/957,006 filed Jun. 21, 2013. The entire contents of each of the prior-filed applications listed above are hereby incorporated by reference. 

FIELD OF THE INVENTION 

[0003] The present disclosure relates to non-volatile memory devices, and in particular to memory devices with magnetic switching elements. 

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 

[0004] Many applications today require large amounts of data to be stored and accessed quickly. Magnetic hard disk drives (HDDs) provide dense, non-volatile storage at low cost per bit, but the access times of these devices are intrinsically long, limited by the speed of the moving disk. Other storage components further up the memory hierarchy provide faster access times but at much lower density (e.g., on-chip cache). Aside from solid state memories such as Flash, these alternative technologies require a stable power supply for indefinite storage. And even the non-volatile memories such as flash have limited life cycles. 

[0005] In the past ten years the search for a fast, non-volatile, dense memory technology has focused a spotlight on a non-volatile random access memory known as the magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM). 

[0006] In one approach, an MRAM can be based on a three-terminal memory element that can be switched by a phenomenon known as current-driven domain wall motion [see Fukami, et al., "Low-Current Perpendicular Domain Wall Motion Cell for Scalable High-Speed MRAM, 2009 Symposium on VLSI Technology Digest of Technical Papers, 2009]. This approach includes at least two CMOS access transistors, which can increase bitcell size, and also use non-optimal materials due to shared read- and write-paths. 

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 

[0007] In one aspect, a bitcell includes a first magnetic switching cell to receive a data bit, and a buffer comprising a second magnetic switching cell to receive a bitline value, wherein the bitline value is transferred from the buffer to the first magnetic switching cell as the data bit for a later read operation. 

[0008] Implementations can include one or more of the following features. The bitcell can include a write bitline connected to the buffer for writing the bitline value to the buffer by asserting a predetermined write voltage level on the write bitline. The bitcell can include a write bitline connected to the buffer for writing the bitline value to the buffer by causing a current having a predetermined value and a predetermined direction to flow on the write bitline. 

[0009] In some examples, the bitcell can include first and second write wordlines connected to the buffer. The first and second write wordlines can effect a transfer of the bitline value from the buffer to the first magnetic switching cell by asserting first and second predetermined voltage levels on the respective first and second write wordlines. For example, the first and second voltage levels can correspond to the first and second write wordlines. The first voltage level can include a first predetermined voltage level. The second voltage level can include a second predetermined voltage level. The first predetermined voltage level can include a polarity that is opposite to a polarity of the second predetermined voltage level. 

[0010] The bitcell can include a read wordline connected to the first magnetic switching cell for reading the bitline value from the first magnetic switching cell by asserting a predetermined read voltage level on the read wordline. The bitcell can include a read bitline connected to the first magnetic switching cell for sensing a current passing through the first magnetic switching cell. The bitcell can include a read bitline connected to the first magnetic switching cell for sensing an impedance value of the first magnetic switching cell. 

[0011] The buffer can include a third magnetic switching cell connected to the second magnetic switching cell. In some examples, the third magnetic switching cell can be switched in a different direction from that of the second switching magnetic cell in the buffer. The buffer can include a magnetic tunnel junction based device having a fixed resistance value and connected to the second magnetic switching cell. The buffer can include a resistive device connected to the second magnetic switching cell. 

[0012] The resistive device includes a magnetic tunnel junction device. At least one of the first and second magnetic switching cells can be based on a selected one of a 1) spin-, or 2) spin-orbit, or 3) a combination of spin- and spin-orbit torque principle. At least one of the first and second magnetic switching cells can be based on a selected one of a 1) spin-transfer torque principle, 2) spin Hall effect, 3) Rashba effect, or 4) combination of spin-transfer torque principle, spin Hall effect, and Rashba effect. 

[0013] An output of the buffer can be set to a predetermined ratio of two resistance values. A first write bitline connected to the buffer can be asserted to a first reference voltage, and first and second write wordlines can be asserted to predetermined first and second voltage levels, respectively, to cause a current to flow through a write-path of the first magnetic switching cell, a direction of the current determined by the predetermined ratio of the two resistance values. 

[0014] The bitcell can include a circuit element for blocking current sneak paths in the bitcell, wherein the circuit element is a selected one of a) a diode, b) a capacitor, or c) a transistor. In some aspects, the bitcell can be a magnetic bitcell that is independent of a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) device. 

[0015] In another aspect, a memory device includes at least four bitcells arranged such that each bitcell shares one or more wordlines with another of the four bitcells, and shares one or more bitlines with yet another of the four bitcells. Each bitcell includes a first magnetic switching cell to receive a data bit, and a buffer comprising a second magnetic switching cell to receive a bitline value, wherein the bitline value is transferred from the buffer to the first magnetic switching cell as the data bit for a later read operation. 

[0016] Implementations can include one or more of the following features. The memory device can include a sensing circuit connected to at least one of the four bitcells to detect the bitline value stored in the corresponding first magnetic switching cell of the bitcell at least by sensing a logical state of the bitcell. The memory device can include a sensing circuit that includes a third magnetic switching cell and one or more resistors in connection with the third magnetic switching cell. A write bitline can connect a first buffer of a first bitcell in series with a second buffer of a second bitcell within the memory device. The write bitline can connect magnetic switching cells of the first and second buffers in series such that a logical state of the write bitline is represented by a current flowing through write-paths of the first and second magnetic switching cells. 

[0017] In another aspect, a bitcell includes a magnetic switching cell to receive a data bit, the magnetic switching cell including a programming path, and an evaluation path whose resistance can switch between a first resistance state and a second resistance state, the first resistance state being lower than the second resistance state, in response to signals magnetically coupled from the programming path, the programming path being electrically isolated from the evaluation path, and a buffer including at least a transistor to receive a bitline value, wherein the bitline value is transferred from the buffer to the magnetic switching cell as the data bit for a later read operation. 

[0018] Implementations can include one or more of the following features. The magnetic switching cell can be based on a selected one of a 1) spin-, or 2) spin-orbit, or 3) a combination of spin- and spin-orbit torque principle. The magnetic switching cell can be based on a selected one of a 1) spin-transfer torque principle, 2) spin Hall effect, 3) Rashba effect, or 4) combination of spin-transfer torque principle, spin Hall effect, and Rashba effect. 

[0019] In another aspect, a method includes receiving a data bit value at a buffer in a bitcell based on a first state of a write bitline connected to the buffer, and transferring the data bit value from the buffer to a first magnetic switching cell in the bitcell for a later read operation at least by holding the write bitline to a reference value different from the first state, and asserting first and second predetermined voltage levels on respective first and second write wordlines connected to the buffer. 

[0020] Implementations can include one or more of the following features. Receiving a data bit value at a buffer includes storing the data bit value in a second magnetic switching cell in the buffer. The method can also include asserting a predetermined read voltage level on a read wordline connected to the first magnetic switching cell, and sensing a current passing through the first magnetic switching cell on a read bitline connected to the first magnetic switching cell. 

[0021] Details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages will be apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 

[0037] A non-volatile magnetic memory array, such as an MRAM, includes a plurality of memory elements called "bitcells." Each bitcell is capable of storing information in the form of a logical state, i.e., a state of "logical-1" or "logical-0" corresponding to a high or low resistance state of the bitcell, respectively. For example, an MRAM can be implemented by a device based on the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) phenomenon (called an MTJ device or element) in series with a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) access transistor. A state of the bitcell can be written when a control signal to the CMOS transistor is high, which passes a large current through the MTJ element that switches its logic state from a high resistance to a low resistance (or vice versa) by a spin torque phenomenon (for example spin-transfer torque, or spin Hall effect, or a combination of the phenomenona). To perform a read operation, a smaller voltage can be applied to the transistor, which passes a sensing current through the MTJ to evaluate its resistance. 

[0038] The present disclosure relates to a non-volatile magnetic memory in which each bitcell includes one or more magnetic elements called "mCells." An mCell is a four-terminal magnetic switching device (or cell). Construction and example operational details of an mCell are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,400,066, entitled "Magnetic Logic Circuits and Systems Incorporating Same," to inventors Lawrence T. Pileggi and Jian-Gang (Jimmy) Zhu, the disclosure of which is incorporated in its entirety herein. 

[0039] As described in detail below, the mCell-based bitcell can include a first magnetic switching cell or a first mCell to receive and store a data bit (i.e., a "1" or a "0" representation). The value stored in the first mCell represents the state of the bitcell. A WRITE operation performed on the bitcell involves programming or storing the data bit into the first mCell. The bitcell includes a temporary storage element called a buffer. For example, the buffer includes a second magnetic switching cell or a second mCell coupled to a resistive device. The WRITE operation is performed on the bitcell in two steps. In a first step, the data bit is received from a write bitline (as described in detail below) and stored in the buffer (i.e., in the second mCell of the buffer). In a second step, the data bit is transferred from the buffer to the first mCell. A later READ operation can sense the value stored in the first magnetic switching cell to determine the data bit value. 

[0040] FIG. 1 shows a cross-section of a magnetic switching cell or mCell 100 in two states 102 and 104. State 102 corresponds to a high resistance state of mCell 100 (which can be regarded, in some implementations, as a logical-1), while state 104 correspondences to a low resistance state (which can be regarded, in some implementations, as a logical-0). As shown, mCell 100 is a four-terminal device. mCell 100 includes two write terminals (w.sup.+, w.sup.-) 106, 108 that constitute a programming or write path 110, and two read terminals (R.sup.+, R.sup.-) 112, 114 that constitute an electrically-insulated, and magnetically-coupled evaluation or read path 116. The write path 110 is switched by pulsing a small current through its terminals 106, 108, which causes a resistance change through one or more MTJs 118 in the read path 116. Additional details about the magnetic switching cell 100 including its operational details can be found in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,400,066. 

[0041] As noted, mCell 100 has electrically isolated write and read paths 110, 116, and can have perpendicular, in-plane, or canted magnetization. mCell 100 can be switched based on current-driven domain wall motion, where the underlying phenomenon can be spin-transfer torque, the spin Hall effect, the Rashba effect, any other spin- or spin-orbit torque, including a combination of spin-transfer torque principle, spin Hall effect, and Rashba effect. In one implementation, the write terminals (w.sup.+, w.sup.-) 106, 108 are shown as fixed magnetic studs, which allow a domain wall to form in the write-path, as described in further detail below. 

[0042] As noted above, the two current paths, i.e., the write path 110 and the read path 116, can be electrically isolated from each other. The write path 110 (also called a programming path) can be used to program mCell 100. The read path 116 (also called the evaluation or sensing path) can be used to evaluate or sense a state of mCell 100. The write terminals 106, 108 can be used to apply currents to switch mCell between a low and a high resistance state (and thereby to a logical-0 and a logical-1 state). The read or evaluation terminals 112, 114 can be used to detect a state (i.e. low or high resistance state) of mCell 100. For example, the read terminals 112, 114 can present a first low resistance when mCell 100 is in a low resistance state, and a second, high resistance when mCell 100 is in a high resistance state. For example, if mCell 100 is a magnetic switching cell or device that is approximately 20 nm in length and width, the terminal-to-terminal resistance of the read path 116 in a low resistance state can be 5000 .OMEGA.. For example, the terminal-to-terminal resistance of the read path 116 of such a device in a high resistance state can be approximately 15,000 .OMEGA.. 

[0043] The application of a programming current from the positive write terminal 106 into mCell 100 and out of the negative write terminal 108 causes a domain wall movement within the write path 110 towards the positive write terminal 106. This results in mCell 100 entering the high resistance state 102 as follows. The flow of the programming current in the write path 110 causes a write domain switching portion 120 to become aligned with the magnetizations in the rest of the write path 110. The read path 116 is electrically isolated from the structures that make up the write path 110, but is magnetically coupled to the write domain switching portion 120 of the write path 110. As a result of the magnetic coupling, a read domain switching portion 124 in the read path 116 follows the magnetization of the write domain switching portion 120. The magnetizations of the write and read domain switching portions 120, 124 are therefore shown to be in the same direction (i.e., both downward). Because the magnetization of the read domain switching portion 124 is not aligned (i.e. antiparallel) with the magnetizations in the rest of the read path 116, the read path 116 presents a high resistance to the evaluation current. As a result, at this point, mCell 100 assumes the high resistance state 102. To read the high resistance state 102 of mCell 100, the resistance of the read path 116 is sensed by applying an evaluation current, which is different from the programming current, to the read terminals 112, 114. 

[0044] Similarly, a current flowing from the negative write terminal 108 and out of the positive write terminal 106 can cause the domain wall to position itself proximate to the negative write terminal 108. This causes mCell 100 to assume the low resistance state 104. Accordingly, the magnetization of the read domain switching portion 124 is reversed and aligned (i.e. parallel) with the magnetizations in the rest of the read path 116. As such, the read path 116 presents a high resistance state 104 to the evaluation current. 

[0045] FIG. 2 illustrates a schematic symbol 200 for mCell 100. As shown, the schematic symbol includes write terminals (w.sup.+, w.sup.-) 106, 108 marking a beginning and an end of the write path and read terminals (R.sup.+, R.sup.-) 112, 114 marking a beginning and an end of the read path of mCell 100. 

[0046] In some implementations, a domain wall can be initialized with an applied field. Such an applied field can be established by passing a current through a neighboring wire, which can be, for example, a bitline, wordline, or ground rail in the context of a memory array. Referring to FIG. 3, a domain wall in a write path of an mCell (e.g., write path 110 of mCell 100 in FIG. 1) can be established by applying a magnetic field 304. As shown, a current passing through a neighboring wire 300, such as, a bitline, establishes the magnetic field 304. The magnetic field 304 causes a domain wall 306 to be formed in the mCell write path 308. In some examples, magnetic devices that are single-domain such that no domain wall is present can be used. 

[0047] FIGS. 4 and 5 show example mCell structures 400, 500 that can be used in some implementations. In these structures, the switching mechanism is a spin-orbit torque. Further details concerning these mCell structures can be found in, for example, co-pending PCT Application No. PCT/US2013/073073, entitled "A Nonvolatile Magnetic Logic Device," the disclosure of which is incorporated in its entirety herein. 

[0048] An mCell can have high thermal stability, i.e., an ability to function at high temperatures. As such, mCells can be deeply-scaled and are also 3D-stackable, thereby making extremely high-density non-volatile memory possible. Since the magnetic elements that form the array of bitcells can be deposited on a CMOS chip but without requiring interconnections to the silicon substrate for each bitcell (only for the CMOS periphery circuits), the density can be extremely high and limited only by the scaling dimensions of the magnetic elements and the bitline and wordline interconnect lines. The memory is capable of doing multi-port operations due to the isolated read and write paths of the mCells (see, e.g., write and read paths 110, 116 of FIG. 1). In implementations, current-based signaling and all-magnetic bitcells also makes this memory technology immune to noise sources that plague traditional SRAM and DRAM. Current signaling also enables the voltage levels to be as small as 10's of millivolts, and avoids the significant power dissipation associated with charging and discharging capacitive circuit nodes during typical CMOS operation. 

[0049] Referring to FIG. 6, in an implementation, a bitcell 600 consists of two mCells 604 and 608 and a resistive device 612. mCell 608 and resistive device 612 together constitute a scratch buffer 614. Scratch buffer 614 is similar to an example of an inverter described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,400,066. 

[0050] The two mCells 604 and 608 perform different roles in bitcell 600. mCell 604 holds the data bit value that represents the state of bitcell 600. For example, if a state of bitcell 600 is represented to be "0", it is taken to mean that mCell 604 holds a data bit value of "0" (or, in some examples, is in a state of low resistance). Similarly, if a state of bitcell 600 is represented to be "1", it is taken to mean that mCell 604 holds a data bit value of "1" (or, in some examples, is in a state of high resistance). mCell 608, on the other hand, as part of buffer 614, temporarily holds the data bit value ("0" or "1") before transferring it to mCell 604. In some implementations, the buffer 614 operates as an inverter and holds an inverse of the data bit value. 

[0051] A plurality of bitcells (including bitcell 600) can be arranged in series of rows and columns and can even be stacked on top of one another. As shown, mCells 604, 608 and resistive device 612 are connected to the rest of a memory array though a network of bitlines and wordlines. These bitlines and wordlines variously perform READ or WRITE operations on the bitcell 600. A first read terminal 616 of mCell 604 is connected to a read writeline (RWL) 620. A second read terminal 624 of mCell 604 is connected to a read bitline (RBL) 628, which in turn is connected to a sense amplifier (not shown). For example, the sense amplifier can be a transresistance or a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) that can sense an evaluation current to determine a state of mCell 604. 

[0052] The mCell 608 has read terminals 632 and 636 that connect mCell 608 in series with resistive device 612. The buffer 614 (including mCell 608 and buffer 612) is connected to a first write wordline (WWL+) 640 on one end and a second write wordline (WWL-) 644 on another end. In addition, a first write terminal 650 of the second mCell 608 is connected to write bitline (WBL) 652. A second write terminal 654 of mCell 608 is connected to a ground line (GND) 656. In like manner, a first write terminal 658 of mCell 604 is connected to the first read terminal 632 of mCell 608. The second write terminal 662 is connected to the ground line (GND) 656. 

[0053] In some implementations, the resistive device 612 in the buffer 614 can be a standard resistor. In some implementations, the resistive device 612 can be implemented with magnetic materials (e.g., a device that is based on the magnetic tunnel junction phenomenon and having a fixed resistance value). In some implementations, the resistive device 612 can be a third mCell that is operated as a resistive device. For example, the third mCell can be a non-switchable mCell. 

[0054] Addressing first a WRITE operation, the write bitline (WBL) 652 is driven to either V.sup.+ or V.sup.-, depending on the data bit value being written. For example, if the data bit value is "1", then the write bitline (WBL) 652 is driven to V.sup.-; if the data bit value is "0" then the write bitline (WBL) 652 is driven to V.sup.-. This data bit value is stored in the buffer 614. In particular, the data bit value is stored in mCell 608 of the buffer 614. When the write bitline (WBL) 652 goes to either V.sup.+ or V.sup.-, a potential difference is created across the write terminals 650, 654 of mCell 608, leading to a certain directionality of current that programs the state of mCell 608 to either a logic-1 or logic-0 depending on the applied voltage on the write bitline (WBL) 652. For example, mCell 608 stores a data bit value of "1" by causing the read path magnetization to become anti-parallel and thus enter a state of high resistance (see FIG. 1). Similarly, mCell 608 stores a data bit value of "0" by causing the read path magnetization to become parallel and thus enter a state of low resistance. 

[0055] In the manner described above, the buffer 614 captures the bitline logic value for each corresponding row in a memory array. Next, the bitline logic value is transferred to mCell 608. For the row(s) that will write the bitline value into mCell 604, the write bitline (WBL) 652, which was previously asserted to V.sup.+ or V.sup.-, is held at ground (GND) as the write wordlines WWL+ 640 and WWL- 644 are asserted to V.sup.+ and V.sup.-, respectively. This causes a current to flow through the write terminals 658, 662 of mCell 604, the directionality of which is determined by the ratio of the read path resistance of mCell 608 to the resistance of the resistive device 612. 

[0056] In particular, current originates from the first write wordline (WWL+) 640 and flows through the resistive device 612. If the read path resistance of mCell 608 is high, then a net positive current from the write wordline (WWL+) 640 flows through resistive device 612 flows through the write terminals from 658 to 662 of mCell 604 to change the resistance of mCell 604. This resistance value of 604 represents the stored logic bit for the bitcell. On the other hand, if the read path resistance of mCell 608 is low, then a net current flows out of the write terminals 662, 658 of mCell 604 and towards the second write worldline (WWL-) 644 via the read path of mCell 608. This mechanism programs the bit value of mCell 604. The ratio of the read path resistance of mCell 608 to the resistance of the resistive device 612 steers the current in the bitcell 600 in a predetermined way (based on, e.g. a selected resistance value of the resistive device 612) so as to program the state of the mCell 604. The current flow through the write terminals 658, 662 of mCell 604 performs the function of programming the bitcell 600. 

[0057] As previously noted (see, e.g. discussion in connection with FIG. 1), the state of storing a data bit value as a high or low resistance depends on a polarity (i.e. direction) of write current through the write inputs of e.g mCell 604 as it flows through write terminals 658 and 662. As noted, the polarity of the write current is determined by the resistance state of mCell 608 relative to the resistive device 612. In the example of FIG. 6, the mCell 604 is programmed to be in a state of low resistance. Similarly, if mCell 608 was in a low resistance state, then mCell 604 is programmed to be in a high resistance state. As noted above, mCell 604 thus holds the data value of the bitcell 600. 

[0058] The write bitline (WBL) 652 need not be asserted to any particular predetermined state. So long as the write bitline (WBL) 652 was previously asserted, that previously asserted value is captured by the buffer 614 and stored in mCell 608. In this regard, the buffer is non-volatile, i.e., it is configured to capture and retain the last write bitline (WBL) 652 value for a subsequent operation. 

[0059] To perform a READ operation, the write wordlines (WWL+) and (WWL-) 640, 644 are returned to GND, and the read wordline (RWL) 620 is asserted to V. As a result, an evaluation current flows through read terminals 616, 624 of mCell 604 and can be sensed on the read bitline (RBL) 628. 

[0060] In some implementations, the scratch buffer can include two mCells whereby the pull-up fixed resistor can be replaced by an mCell that is programmed to switch in a direction that is opposite to the direction of mCell 608. 

[0061] FIG. 7 shows an example 2.times.2 memory array 700 based on a plurality of bitcells 704-716 using magnetic elements (such as bitcell 600). Like conventional memory technologies such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and static random access memory (SRAM), the memory array is divided into rows and columns. Each row shares the same wordlines 720, and each column shares the same bitlines 724, allowing for addressing anywhere in the array 700. Each wordline 720 is connected to an inverter or buffer (not shown) that sets the line voltage to the required value (as indicated in the schematic and described in the previous paragraph in the context of one bitcell) when activated by the proper control signal (also indicated in the schematic). 

[0062] During a READ operation, a high voltage is applied to the appropriate read wordline (RWL) (e.g., 732 or 736), causing a sensing current to flow through the mCell read path it is connected to (e.g., 740 or 744). The sensing current is conveyed on the read bitlines (RBL) 725, 726, which are connected to respective sensing transimpedance amplifiers (TIA) 728. The magnitude of the sensing current depends on the read path resistance (and therefore, the logic state) of the corresponding mCell 740, 744 and can be compared to a reference current at the sensing transimpedance amplifier (TIA) 728. The output of the TIA 728 indicates if mCells 740 or 744 are in high or low resistance states. 

[0063] In some implementations, an input 748 of the TIA 728 through which the sensing current flows is held at virtual ground to prevent the current from "sneaking" into other devices in the array 700. 

[0064] FIG. 8 shows a sample simulation of the memory array 700. For example, the bit pattern "10" is written to the bitcells 704, 708 in a top row of the array 700 and "01" to the bitcells 712, 716 in a bottom row of the array 700. 

[0065] During a first half cycle 804, WBL[0] 752 is asserted to +50 mV (corresponding to a logical-1), while WBL[1] 756 is asserted to -50 mV (corresponding to a logical-1). This causes the respective bitcell buffers to store the logical-1 and logical-0 states as discussed previously. 

[0066] In the second half cycle 808, the WBL[0] 752 and WBL[1] 756 lines are held at 0 mV, while the pair of lines WWLp[0] and WWLn[0] (corresponding to WWL[0]+ and WWL[0]- in FIG. 7) are asserted to +50 mV and -50 mV, respectively. This causes the values held in the buffers of the bitcells 704, 708 in the top row of the array 700 to transfer to the storage mCell (e.g., mCell 740) of the respective bitcells 704, 708. At the same time, WWLp[1] and WWLn[1] (corresponding to WWL[1]+ and WWL[1]- in FIG. 7) are held at 0 mV, so that the values held in the buffers of the bitcells 712, 716 in the lower row of the array 700 are not transferred. At the end of the second half cycle 808, the top row bitcells 704, 708 hold the values "1" and "0". In a similar manner, during the next write first and second half cycles 812 and 816, the values "0" and "1" are written to the bitcells 712, 716 of the bottom row of the array 700. 

[0067] As shown, during a first read cycle 820, RWL[0] 732 is asserted to read from the top row of the array 700. RBL[0] 725 returns a higher current than RBL[1] 726, indicating the pattern "10" is being read. In a second read cycle, 824, RWL[1] is asserted to read the bottom row of the array 700, and this time RBL[0] returns a smaller current than RBL[1], indicating the pattern "01" is being read. 

[0068] In some implementations, entire words (rows) can be written to or read from at the same time. In some examples, other circuitry can be placed in the periphery (i.e., not in the array itself) to allow for access to individual cells or clusters of cells within a row. Because the read- and write-paths of the mCells are electrically-isolated, the bitcells allow multi-port access such that read and write operations can be completed in a same cycle. 

[0069] In some implementations, because the bitcells consist of all magnetic devices, memory density can be very high compared to other MRAM approaches that require a transistor in every bitcell. For example, referring to FIG. 9, a single planar bitcell layout 900 is shown. In this layout, the size is limited to four metal pitches by three metal pitches. Referring to FIG. 10, mCells 1000 can be stacked, further increasing memory density. 

[0070] Array periphery elements (i.e., anything not in the bitcell array itself) can be designed using standard CMOS devices. In such implementations, no additional circuitry may be needed. All known memory partitioning styles and hierarchy alternatives, in addition to circuit and layout methods including column-multiplexing and pitch-matching, can still be applicable. Because, in some implementations, no transistors are required in the bitcells, an entire array periphery can be fabricated directly underneath a memory array, which greatly reduces the overall system size when compared to a memory that requires the periphery to be physically placed adjacent to the array. This makes the implementation of an mCell-based high-density, non-volatile commodity memory easier than other approaches that require new CMOS interfaces. 

[0071] In some implementations, the V.sup.+ and V.sup.- supply voltages for the magnetic devices can be smaller than those used for conventional CMOS devices, such as 50-100 mV for the mCells, and 1V for the CMOS. This can involve slightly different configurations for the CMOS periphery logic circuits that drive the mCell-based bitcells. 

[0072] In an implementation, a bitcell for a non-volative memory array can be constructed using only mCells (e.g., such as mCell 100 of FIG. 1), and no CMOS access transistors. Such a construction would render the MRAM scheme as having all magnetic elements. FIG. 11 shows an all-magnetic memory array 1100, in which each bitcell (e.g., bitcell 1104) uses three mCell devices 1108-1116. In this implementation, a scratch buffer 1120, which consists of mCells 1112 and 1116, is connected to a write bitline (WBL) 1124 in series, such that the logic state of the write bitline (WBL) 1224 is represented by the direction of the current flow through the series connected mCell write path. The WBL current programs the resistance states of mCells 1112 and 1116 in opposite directions, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,400,066. As previously noted (see, e.g., the description of bitcell operation regarding FIG. 6), the ratio of the read path resistance of mCell 1116 to the read path resistance of mCell 1112 (in place of the resistive device of FIG. 6) steers a current into or out of the write path terminals of mCell 1108. All scratch buffers connected to a WBL are programmed when a positive or negative current signal is asserted. A direction of the current flowing along the WBL indicates the data bit value to be written to the cell. In other respects, the memory array 1100 operates in a similar manner described above in connection with FIGS. 6-8, and as described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,400,066. 

[0073] FIG. 12 shows an implementation of an all-magnetic memory array 1200 in which a bitcell 1202 includes three mCells 1204-1212 and a diode 1218. As shown, similar to the array in FIG. 11 (array 1100), a scratch buffer 1216, which consists of mCells 1208 and 1212, is connected in series to write bitline (WBL) 1220. Diode 1218 can help in blocking sneak currents that can disturb the stored states of mCells 1204-1212 in the bitcell 1202. The configuration of FIG. 12 can also be applied to a two and one-half mCell bitcell without loss of generality. As shown, a read operation can be performed using resistors and an mCell as an analog comparator 1212. 

[0074] Referring to FIG. 13, a memory array 1300 can be implemented in which each bitcell 1304-1316 includes a transistor (e.g., CMOS transistor 1320) coupled with an mCell (e.g., mCell 1324). The transistor 1320 performs a function of the buffer (e.g., buffer 614 of FIG. 6) described above. In particular, during a WRITE operation, the transistor 1320 receives a bitline value, a data bit, which is transferred to mCell 1324 for a later READ operation. mCell 1324 receives the data bit from the transistor 1324 during a second half cycle of the WRITE operation as discussed in connection with FIG. 8. 

[0075] As noted above, mCell 1324 includes a write or programming path and a read or evaluation path. The read path resistance can switch between a first, low resistance state and a second, high resistance state in response to signals magnetically coupled from the write path. In this regard, the write path can be electrically isolated from the read path. 

[0076] Certain mCell-based memory implementations also offer high density MRAM configurations 1400 and 1500 as shown in FIGS. 14 and 15, where capacitors 1404 and diodes 1504 are coupled to respective mCells 1408, 1508 and integrated into every bitcell 1412, 1512. These extra devices 1404, 1504 can be used to block current "sneak paths" that may disturb the stored states of other mCells in the array. Although these examples require combining mCells with other technologies in every bitcell 1412, 1512, the capacitor 1304 and the diode 1404 can be implemented without requiring connections from every bitcell 1412, 1512 to a CMOS substrate. For example, a diode 1404 can be an effective means of breaking DC coupling among the read paths, thereby avoiding a need to set a read bitline to a virtual ground. This simplifies the read periphery circuit requirements, such that it becomes possible to perform the read function using resistors and an mCell as an analog comparator, such as the one shown in FIG. 12 (see mCell-based analog comparator 1212). In addition, instead of requiring a connection from every bitcell 1512 to a diode 1504 on the silicon substrate, it is possible to deposit materials in a back end of line (BEOL) stack that can be used to form the diode 1504, such as a polysilicon material and a metal to form a Schottky diode. 

[0077] Other examples are within the scope and spirit of the description and claims. Additionally, certain functions described above can be implemented using software, hardware, firmware, hardwiring, or combinations of any of these. Features implementing functions may also be physically located at various positions, including being distributed such that portions of functions are implemented at different physical locations.

Physically Unclonable Functions Using Neuromorphic Networks 

Abstract
The disclosure describes the use of a neural network circuit, such as an oscillatory neural network or cellular neural network, to serve as a physically unclonable function on an integrated circuit or within an electronic system. The manufacturing process variations that impact the initial state of the neural network parameters are used to provide the unique identification for the physically unclonable function. A challenge signal to the neural network results in a response that is unique to the circuits process variations. The neural network is designed such that there are random variations among manufactured circuits, but that the specific instance variations are sufficiently deterministic with respect to circuit aging and environmental conditions such as temperature and supply voltage.

Description


CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS 

[0001] This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. .sctn.119 of Provisional Ser. No. 62/122,964, filed Nov. 3, 2014, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 

[0003] The invention relates generally to physically unclonable functions. More specifically, the invention relates to a neuromorphic network that can be used for creating a physically unclonable function. 

[0004] The human brain is a powerful computing system that performs information processing quite efficiently via its massively parallel neural mechanism. Analog Neural Networks (ANNs) attempt to mimic this neural mechanism in the human brain in order to overcome some bottlenecks of the traditional von Neumann machines, especially for computationally-intensive applications such as image processing and pattern recognition. 

[0005] The Cellular Neural Network (CNN) that was first proposed by L. O. Chua and L. Yang in 1988 is a special class of ANNs as it offers only local interconnections among the artificial neurons. Regardless of the number of neurons in the CNN system, each neuron is connected to only the neighboring neurons within a specified radius r and itself. For example, referring to a two-dimensional CNN architecture shown in FIG. 1, for r=1 the cell in the center interacts only with the eight immediately adjacent cells and itself, whereas it interacts with the sixteen cells as well for r=2. This radius can be extended for better accuracy such that all neurons share one-to-one connections like the other ANN systems, but CNNs can be built for more efficient hardware implementations using the smallest possible radius that corresponds to only 9 connections for each neuron. 

[0006] Recently, heterogeneous devices and materials have been proposed and implemented as electronic synapses. Of particular interest has been RRAM, which offers non-volatility for such devices. The voltage-controlled resistances that remain the same even when powered off are adjusted to have programmable synaptic weights. Some proposals have also been made for creating neural networks using other types of emerging devices and materials, such as aluminum nitride and magnetics. 

[0007] Further inspired by the oscillatory nature of some brain sub-systems, others have proposed an Oscillatory Neural Network (ONN) architecture based on coupling phase-locked loops (PLLs) in a network. A single cell of this network is shown conceptually in FIG. 2. In the parlance of neuromorphic computing, the PLL acts as the "neuron," integrating and storing the state of the system as its phase while the connections act as the "synapses," or the weighted influence of one neuron on another. It has been shown that in this style of network, the neurons all synchronize to the same frequency and that their relative phases settle to a pattern stored in the network. 

.tau. x c t = - g ( x c ( t ) ) + d .di-elect cons. N ( c ) a c , d y d ( t ) + u c ( 1 ) ##EQU00001## 

[0008] Equation 1 is the state space definition of a neuromorphic network. The state of the network is given by x.sub.c, the output from each neighbor is given by y.sub.d, the weight between the neurons of the system is given by a.sub.c,d, and the input to the cell is given by u.sub.c. Since it is a dynamical system, the initial condition x.sub.c(0) will affect the final settled value of x.sub.c(t). 

[0009] ONNs and CNNs are implementations of the same fundamental state-space equation, given in Equation 1. This state space maps an input vector of length N to an output vector of length N, where N is the number of neurons in the network. The input can be provided by either forcing an initial condition or by providing an input into the summation. The system is then allowed to converge to the closest energy minimum which is defined by the synaptic weights. When using them as an associative memory, these minima are defined by the training the values of the synapses that define the connectivity between neurons. 

[0010] If, on the other hand, the weights and initial conditions are not explicitly set by the user, the energy landscape would be defined by process variations. Therefore, the system has a set of patterns stored in it upon fabrication, and these patterns are randomly determined by the variability during manufacturing. This variability can be exploited for use as a Physically Unclonable Function (PUF). 

[0011] PUFs are a method of using intrinsic random physical features of an instance of a chip for the purpose of simple counterfeit detection or as the seed for more complex cryptographic functions. PUFs leverage uncontrollable physical die-to-die variation in integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing to generate unique identifiers, meaning a single mask can be used to generate a large number of chips that can uniquely identify themselves. Unlike a simple ID code, however, a PUF is a function--namely it returns a uniquely identifiable output (or response) in response to an input (or challenge). 

[0012] However, CMOS-based PUFs suffer from inconsistencies over a range of temperatures and voltages. In addition, some architectures, such as arbiters and ring oscillators, can be vulnerable to attack. In such an attack, a PUF challenge response could be predicted based on a subset of known responses. One key in a strong PUF is that the physical secret should be prohibitively difficult to predict after modeling. An attractive quality of using a neural network as the function to produce an output based on the physical secret is the non-linear nature of the network will obfuscate the initial conditions and random parameters. The number of connections in a large network makes an attempt to learn the system through a modeling attack prohibitive, if not impossible. This is unlike simpler delay-based arbiters or ring oscillator PUF designs. The neural network-based PUF will not need additional circuitry to attempt to obfuscate the secret further. 

[0013] It would therefore be advantageous to develop an architecture that can be used as a PUF, but that does not suffer from the drawbacks of PUFs created from traditional CMOS-based devices. 

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 

[0014] According to embodiments of the present disclosure is a neuromorphic network that can function as a PUF. The randomness of the initial state and conditions of the artificial neurons and/or synapses represent a unique identifier for the manufactured IC. If truly random, then no two ICs would have the exact same initial state or conditions for large enough analog neural networks. This variability is the fundamental feature needed to construct a PUF for secure IC applications. 

[0015] In one embodiment of the present invention, the circuitry of the neuromorphic network is similar to that used in an ONN or CNN to perform the PUF function. More specifically, in one embodiment the neuromorphic network consists of a plurality of interconnected nodes, or artificial neurons, where the weighted outputs of several nodes in a first layer are summed and used as the input of a second layer node. An input to the network will represent a "challenge" that will receive a "response" based on the random initial state and conditions of the network. To function as a PUF, the system relies on the initial state being truly random from die-to-die to distinguish one IC from another, while being consistent for repeated queries on a single die. This unclonable random initial state must remain consistent for all product aging and environmental conditions. Most importantly, the design of the neural network can be structured to accommodate some small perturbations with aging. For example, consider one embodiment in which an ONN based on oscillators is used for neurons and programmable resistances are used for synapses, whereby the stored information is the total phase shifts among the oscillators upon startup. Since the response to any challenge is an aggregate response due to the phase relationships among all of the artificial neurons, small shifts in the initial phase states relative to neighboring neuron phases will have only a limited impact on the overall response. This is due to the inherent nature of neural networks that perform their computation based on imprecise data.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 

[0032] Embodiments of the present invention and its advantages are best understood by referring to the figures. FIG. 2 shows a cell of a neural network 106 according to one embodiment, where the neuron 102 comprises an analog processing element 201. Each cell has an input 103 and an output 104. The input 103 is comprised of the weighted sum of the output of all neighboring neurons 102 connected by synapses 105. In this particular embodiment, the values of the input 103 (shown as X.sub.1) and the output (shown as Y.sub.1) can be any analog value such as current, voltage, or some other physical quantity. In an Oscillatory Neural Network (ONN), the value of the input 103 and output 104 is the phase of the oscillator 301. 

[0033] FIG. 3 shows, in general, an ONN where information in the system is stored as the phase of the output signals of each of the phase-locked loops (PLLs) 202. In terms of a neural network 106, the neuron 102 comprises the PLL 202 and the synapses 105 are the connections between the PLL 202 and neighboring neuron outputs 104. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the neuron 102 is implemented as a PLL 202 built around devices showing S-type negative differential resistance (S-NDR) behavior. These phase-change or oxide-based devices are used as nano-oscillators which store the state of the system. 

[0034] A schematic showing a single cell, or neuron 102, of the network 106 according to the preferred embodiment is shown in FIG. 4. As shown in FIG. 4, the neuron 102 is a nano-oscillator 301 comprising a RRAM cell 302 in series with a PMOS transistor 303. The phase of each oscillator 301 is locked to a weighted sum of the phases of neighboring neurons 102. The resistance values of W.sub.l1 to W.sub.n1 are the values of the synaptic weights. In this particular embodiment, the weighted sum signal is measured with a phase-frequency detector (PFD) 304, which uses digital circuitry to convert the phase difference into a voltage to drive the voltage controlled oscillator 301. As further shown in FIG. 4, XOR logic gates 305 on the left side of the neuron 102 provide the sign inversion needed for some weights in the network 106. 

[0035] The state of the network 106 is stored as the relative phase between the oscillators 301, and therefore the input vector will be a waveform of phase 0 or 180 degrees. The output vector is generated by measuring the phase of each neuron 102 relative to a reference neuron 102, and thresholding them to be either 0 or 180 degrees. Thresholding is used in the preferred embodiment because the phase settles quickly to a value near 0 or 180, but complete settling takes a longer period of time. For example, if the phase of a neuron 102 settles to 2, then the thresholding step would cause the phase to be indicated as 0, since the phase is more likely to completely settle to 0 than 180. 

[0036] The physical randomness needed for the PUF comes from the randomization of the initial condition of the network 106, which is based on the initial phase of the individual oscillators 301 comprising the network 106. For example, FIG. 5 shows a high-level schematic of a neural network 106 showing multiple neurons 102 in a cellular connectivity pattern. The state of the network 106 is stored as the values of the various phases of the individual neurons 102, shown in FIG. 5 as .phi.(t). The bits, that can be the challenge to the PUF in some embodiments of the invention, are input at each neuron 102 and are represented by X.sub.i. The response of the PUF to the challenge is the equilibrium achieved by the network 106. Stated differently, the response to a challenge of any individual neuron 102 is affected by the phase of connected neurons 102, which is dependent on its initial condition. Because the initial condition results from the incubation time of the oscillator 301 (i.e. time for the oscillator 301 to begin oscillating), each neuron 102 will have a different initial condition. Consequently, the randomization of the initial condition of the network 106--determined by the incubation time of the oscillators 301--is the variability needed to implement the PUF. 

[0037] As previously indicated, the oscillators 301 used in the preferred embodiment are based on devices exhibiting S-NDR behavior. This behavior is seen in transition metal oxides and chalcogenide-based phase change materials (also known as threshold switches). It has been widely known that disordered glasses (including polycrystalline films with defects) like chalcogenides and some transition metal oxides show a characteristic bistability in their resistance states. As an example of one such device, Ta.sub.2O.sub.5-x devices exhibit transient and reversible localization of current; thus, this material can be used as an S-type NDR device. 

[0038] The negative differential resistance observed in a transition metal oxide material can be utilized as an oscillatory element. The oscillatory element comprises a dielectric material 402 placed between two electrodes 403, which is shown in the inset of FIG. 6. In one particular embodiment, transition metal oxide based devices 401 are fabricated with 700 nm vertical crossbars consisting of 40 nm of TaO.sub.x as the dielectric material 402 sandwiched between Ta (2 nm)/Pt (10 nm) and Pt (10 nm) electrodes 403. Devices 401 with a TiO.sub.2 based stack can also be used, with the choice of material dependent on factors such as tunability and scalability of these oscillators 301. Change in the device operation in terms of operation voltage and temporal dynamics can be brought about by changing the thickness, electrode material and thermal properties. 

[0039] FIG. 6 shows the circuit schematic of a Ta.sub.2O.sub.5, device 401 connected in series with a 21 k.OMEGA. resistor 404. The accompanying graph of FIG. 6 depicts the negative differential resistance behavior of the device 401. This behavior results from a unique property of transition metal oxide devices which enables the current flowing uniformly through the device 401 to spontaneously and reversibly collapse into a narrow electronic filament, known as a "bifurcation" phenomenon. As the bias across the device-resistance pair is slowly increased (0.1 V/ms), the current through the device 401 increases and eventually, at a threshold voltage, the device 401 enters into the negative differential resistance regime. The threshold voltage is the voltage of the device 401 required to form the temporary electronic filament within the dielectric layer 402, causing a reduction in resistance and a drop in voltage. When the device 401 forms a conductive filament as it enters NDR, this abrupt reduction in resistance is responsible for causing the differential resistance to go negative. 

[0040] To prevent current runaway and permanent changes in the device 401, a series resistance is added in the circuit path. Depending on the over-voltage (differential voltage beyond the threshold voltage) applied to the device 401, the device 401 may settle down to various low resistance states, or ON states. The ON state is completely volatile (corresponding to volatile filament) and the device would revert back to the OFF state (filament dissolved) once the field is removed. The voltage and current associated with this reversal is termed as holding voltage and current. 

[0041] Once the device 401 switches to ON state (i.e. temporary filament formed and temporary low resistance state), the resistance of the device 401 experiences a rapid decrease. Due to the voltage division enforced by the resistance in series, the voltage across the device 401 drops. This drives the device 401 to an I-V point in the ON state that is lower than the holding voltages and current. Thus the electronic filament is unstable and dissolves, driving the device 401 back to the OFF state. Once in high resistance state, the voltage across the device 401 starts increasing, eventually beyond the threshold voltage which causes the device 401 to go back to the ON state. This process repeats itself resulting in self-sustained oscillations, as shown in FIG. 7A. FIG. 7B shows the testing circuitry 405 associated with the device 401, which can be used for testing purposes. The phase portrait of these oscillations can be plotted as shown in FIG. 8A and shows a clear separation of the low (.about.300.OMEGA.) and the high resistance states (100 k.OMEGA.). FIG. 8B shows the stages of the device 401 at various points on the graph in FIG. 8A. For example, at point (1), the device is uniformly conducting electricity. As the voltage increases, filed induced electronic filamentation occurs at point (2). The conductive filament shunts the field at point (3), eventually leading to the decay of the filament in the absence of a field at point (4). 

[0042] Despite the device 401 being stressed with a certain applied voltage beyond the threshold voltage, it takes a well-defined incubation time before the oscillations start. This sets an initial phase offset that propagates through the oscillations and thus sets the initial conditions for the PUF. In other words, any two devices 401 with different incubation times (delay) will result in those two oscillators having two dissimilar phases. It must be noted that a range of voltages can be used to initiate oscillations and the incubation time associated with these voltages can be tuned, as shown in FIG. 9A. The same device 401 has a very tight distribution associated with the incubation time for the oscillations. However, device to device variability of the incubation time is much larger, as captured in FIGS. 9A and 9B. The deviation from the mean is <2% for the same device 401 when the oscillations are initiated. However, a much larger spread of more than 70% is seen due to device 401 to device 401 variation. This incubation time sets the initial phase of the devices 401 and this delay tracks throughout the oscillation cycles. FIG. 9C is a histogram demonstrating the variability. 

[0043] FIG. 10 shows three devices 401 undergoing oscillations at the same frequency but with a phase that is preset by the incubation times of 3.3 .mu.s, 2 .mu.s and 3.7 .mu.s. Individual devices 401 have a consistent incubation period, but the incubation varies from device 401 to device 401, providing the type of randomness needed for the PUF. FIG. 11 shows frequency tuning with a transistor ballast with parasitics (top data points) and extra loading (bottom data points). The inset on the top right of FIG. 11 is an image of the 1T1R device 401. The inset on the bottom right of FIG. 11 is amorphous TaO.sub.x device 401, as seen in the tunneling electron microscope micrograph with FFT of the image in the inset. Amorphous microstructure is the origin of distribution in nucleation times and thus the initial phase. FIG. 12 is another graph showing frequency tuning of a device 401 with a transistor ballast, such circuitry shown in the inset of the graph in FIG. 12. 

[0044] Previously, nucleation theory has been looked at as a tool to analyze this incubation time in phase change materials. Nucleation theory defines a critical radius that any phase should reach before it is stabilized. When the field is applied to the device, the material may have small crystallites in an amorphous matrix corresponding to a conducting phase. However, the radius of these crystallites is very small compared to the critical radius needed for sustained stabilization of the conductive phase. Upon exposing the device to a field for a certain incubation time, the nucleus grows in a manner that creates a cylindrical conductive phase that shunts the field through the device. This incubation time is followed by a rapid decrease in resistance known as threshold switching and subsequently oscillations. During this rapid decrease in the resistance of the device 401, the filament is formed through the device thickness. The nucleation theory predicts that the incubation time should be a function of field and temperature and should be governed by the following equation: 

.tau. = .tau. 0 exp ( W 0 kT V ~ V ) when V > V ~ . ##EQU00002## 

[0045] Here, .tau. is the incubation time, .tau..sub.0 to is the pre-exponential factor (often defined as the inverse of attempt frequency), W.sub.0 is the activation energy, k is the Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature in K, V.about. is the voltage acceleration pre-factor and V is the applied voltage to initiate oscillations. Thus, the incubation time is a strong function of the field dependent activation energy and the attempt frequency. Variability in .tau..sub.0 to represents how many growth attempts it takes at different sub-critical nuclear sites before one of those sub-critical nuclei start growing to form the filament. These sub-critical nuclei are usually the defects in a certain device 401 that are a result of process conditions that a particular device experienced. Thus the defect distribution for a single device 401 is preset while it is impossible for two devices 401 to have the same defect distribution. Thus, different devices 401 have a different attempt frequency and thus a different incubation time. The second source of variability is from the activation energy which has an intrinsic distribution that depends not only on the number of defect sites, but also the orientation of the defect sites through the thickness. Similarly, due to localized conduction through this stochastically grown filament experiences different temperatures depending on the defect orientation (straight versus oblique or irregular filament). Thus, the thermal environment is nearly unique to a single device 401 (reducing cycle to cycle variation) but different devices 401 can have different preferred path shapes and resistances. Moreover, these factors affect the incubation time exponentially and thus there is usually a magnified effect of device 401 to device 401 variability due to variation in defect shape, size, orientation and concentration. Also, the incubation time (initial phase for the PUF) is relatively independent of temperature. 

[0046] The main advantages of this oscillator 301 of this type are: (1) Compact size due to the filamentary nature of the oscillations. (2) Large dynamic change in the voltage during oscillations that can drive other loads, as opposed to other nano-oscillators like spin torque oscillators. (3) Low temperature coefficient of resistance due to the physical mechanism involving a very high-temperature process. (4) Frequency tunability over four orders of magnitude with a ballast device as shown in FIGS. 11 and 12. (5) BEOL CMOS compatibility allows monolithic integration for an area efficient system. 

[0047] The method of performing a physically unclonable function using a neural network 106, according to one embodiment, is depicted in the flowchart as shown in FIG. 13. More specifically, FIG. 13 shows a method that can be used by a manufacturer to authenticate its chip. For example, at step 501, the manufacturer fabricates a neural network 106, which comprises a chip that incorporates an analog processing element 201 and a plurality of additional analog processing elements 201 connected to the first analog processing element 201. As previously discussed, the analog processing element 201 can comprise an oscillator 301, such as the transition metal oxide-based device 401. At step 502, the manufacturer can set a subset of weights if it wants to increase the secrecy of the PUF. Before the chip is shipped to a customer, the manufacturer inputs a challenge at step 503, where the challenge is the weight of some or all of the outputs 104. Once the neurons 102 have settled, the response is read at step 504. If enough data points are obtained to accurately identify the chip, the manufacturer will ship the chip to a customer at step 505. If not, the challenge can be repeated by the manufacturer before shipping. Once received, the customer can then input a challenge at step 506. The response generated by the customer is confirmed with the manufacturer at step 507. If the response matches the response initially observed by the manufacturer, then the chip is authenticated. If the response does not match, then the chip is not secure.

[0048] As previously discussed, the user inputs a configuration of weight patterns as the challenge. This could be done through a digital interface, and will depend precisely on how the weights are implemented. To reduce the possible input space (infinite in the case of analog weights), constraints can be set on the number of weight choices that are possible. The system would then be evaluated, and due to the dynamics of neural networks will settle to each neuron either being a "1" or a "0" based on the weights and the secret initial condition. 

[0049] The secret stored in the neural network-based PUF could be in either randomized weights between the neurons 102 of the network 106 or in randomized initial conditions. The randomized weights could be achieved through the stochastic nature of switching RRAM. A simulated example of this method of PUF generation is given in FIGS. 14A and 14B. In this simulation, two 8-neuron example networks 106 are generated with random synaptic connection weights (either strong or weak). They are given the same initial conditions (challenge) and come to different responses. The first PUF returns 00111001 while the second PUF returns 01110010. 

[0050] This is a small example PUF. Given a much larger neural network 106, it becomes infeasible to attempt to divine the resistance values based only on the input pattern and final settled state due to the complexity of the system. To further increase the randomness of the system, the initial conditions of the neurons 102 are randomized due to process variation as described above. This system defends against modeling attacks by not providing the raw waveforms at the output, but rather whether the final settled phases are in or out of phase with the reference neuron 102. Physical attacks are prevented by the scaling of the RRAM devices 401 to a size where they cannot be probed. Even if physical probing were possible, doing so would introduce defects into the devices (as discussed above), which would change their initial phase, making the system tamper proof. 

[0051] While the disclosure has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modification can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the embodiments. Thus, it is intended that the present disclosure cover the modifications and variations of this disclosure provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.

BACKGROUND 

[0003] 1. Field of the Disclosure 

[0004] The present disclosure generally relates to image processing and image recognition, and more particularly, to a system and method for recognizing and detecting 3D (three-dimensional) objects in 2D (two-dimensional) images using Bayesian network based classifiers. 

[0005] 2. Brief Description of Related Art 

[0006] Object detection is the technique of using computers to automatically locate objects in images, where an object can be any type of a three dimensional physical entity such as a human face, an automobile, an airplane, etc. Object detection involves locating any object that belongs to a category such as the class of human faces, automobiles, etc. For example, a face detector would attempt to find all human faces in a photograph. 

[0007] A challenge in object detection is coping with all the variations in appearance that can exist within a class of objects. FIG. 1A illustrates a picture slide 10 showing some variations in appearance for human faces. For example, the class of human faces may contain human faces for males and females, young and old, bespectacled with plain eyeglasses or with sunglasses, etc. Similarly, for example, another class of objects--cars (not shown)--may contain cars that vary in shape, size, coloring, and in small details such as the headlights, grill, and tires. In case of humans, a person's race, age, gender, ethnicity, etc., may play a dominant role in defining the person's facial features. Also, the visual expression of a face may be different from human to human. One face may appear jovial whereas the other one may appear sad and gloomy. Visual appearance also depends on the surrounding environment and lighting conditions as illustrated by the picture slide 12 in FIG. 1B. Light sources will vary in their intensity, color, and location with respect to the object. Nearby objects may cast shadows on the object or reflect additional light on the object. Furthermore, the appearance of the object also depends on its pose, that is, its position and orientation with respect to the camera. In particular, a side view of a human face will look much different than a frontal view. FIG. 1C shows a picture slide 14 illustrating geometric variation among human faces. Various human facial geometry variations are outlined by rectangular boxes superimposed on the human faces in the slide 14 in FIG. 1C. 

[0008] Therefore, a computer-based object detector must accommodate all these variations and still distinguish the object from any other pattern that may occur in the visual world. For example, a human face detector must be able to find faces regardless of facial expression, variations in the geometrical relationship between the camera and the person, or variation in lighting and shadowing. Most methods for object detection use statistical modeling to represent this variability. Statistics is a natural way to describe a quantity that is not fixed or deterministic, such as a human face. The statistical approach is also versatile. The same statistical modeling techniques can potentially be used to build object detectors for different objects without re-programming. 

[0009] Techniques for object detection in two-dimensional images differ primarily in the statistical model they use. One known method represents object appearance by several prototypes consisting of a mean and a covariance about the mean. Another known technique consists of a quadratic classifier. Such a classifier is mathematically equivalent to the representation of each class by its mean and covariance. These and other known techniques emphasize statistical relationships over the full extent of the object. As a consequence, they compromise the ability to represent small areas in a rich and detailed way. Other known techniques address this limitation by decomposing the model in terms of smaller regions. These methods can represent appearance in terms of a series of inner products with portions of the image. Finally, another known technique decomposes appearance further into a sum of independent models for each pixel. 

[0010] The known techniques discussed above are limited, however, in that they represent the geometry of the object as a fixed rigid structure. This limits their ability to accommodate differences in the relative distances between various features of a human face such as the eyes, nose, and mouth. Not only can these distances vary from person to person, but also their projections into the image can vary with the viewing angle of the face. For this reason, these methods tend to fail for faces that are not in a fully frontal posture. This limitation is addressed by some known techniques, which allow for small amounts of variation among small groups of handpicked features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth. However, because they use a small set of handpicked features, these techniques have limited power. Another known technique allows for geometric flexibility with a more powerful representation by using richer features (each takes on a large set of values) sampled at regular positions across the full extent of the object. Each feature measurement is treated as statistically independent of all others. The disadvantage of this approach is that any relationship not explicitly represented by one of the features is not represented in the statistical model. Therefore, performance depends critically on the quality of the feature choices. 

[0011] Additionally, all of the above techniques are structured such that the entire statistical model must be evaluated against the input image to determine if the object is present. This can be time consuming and inefficient. In particular, since the object can appear at any position and any size within the image, a detection decision must be made for every combination of possible object position and size within an image. It is therefore desirable to detect a 3D object in a 2D image over a wide range of variation in object location, orientation, and appearance. 

[0012] It is also known that object detection may be implemented by forming a statistically based classifier to discriminate the object from other visual scenery. Such a scheme, however, requires choosing the form of the statistical representation and estimating the statistics from labeled training data. As a result, the overall accuracy of the detection program can be dependent on the skill and intuition of the human programmer. It is therefore desirable to design as much of the classifier as possible using automatic methods that infer a design based on actual labeled data in a manner that is not dependant on human intuition. 

[0013] Furthermore, even with very high speed computers, known object detection techniques can require an exorbitant amount of time to operate. It is therefore also desirable to perform the object detection in a computationally advantageous manner so as to conserve time and computing resources. 

[0014] It is also desirable to not only expeditiously and efficiently perform accurate object detection, but also to be able to perform object recognition to ascertain whether two input images belong to the same class of object or to different classes of objects, where often the notion of class is more specific such as images of one person. 

SUMMARY 

[0015] In one embodiment, the present disclosure is directed to a system and a method for detecting an object in a 2D (two-dimensional) image. The method of detection may include, for each of a plurality of view-based detectors, computing a transform of a digitized version of the 2D image containing a representation of an object, wherein the transform is a representation of the spatial frequency content of the image as a function of position in the image. Computing the transform generates a plurality of transform coefficients, wherein each transform coefficient represents corresponding visual information from the 2D image that is localized in space, frequency, and orientation. The method may also include applying the plurality of view-based detectors to the plurality of transform coefficients, wherein each view-based detector is configured to detect a specific orientation of the object in the 2D image based on visual information received from corresponding transform coefficients. Each of the plurality of view-based detectors includes a plurality of stages ordered sequentially where each stage is a classifier. The cascaded stages may be arranged in ascending order of computational complexity. The classifier forming each cascaded stage may be organized as a ratio of two Bayesian networks over relevant features, where each feature is computed from the transform coefficients. The cascaded stages may also be arranged in order of coarse to fine resolution of the image sites at which they evaluate the detector. The method includes combining results of the application of the plurality view-based detectors, and determining a pose (i.e., position and orientation) of the object from the combination of results of the application of the plurality view-based detectors. 

[0016] In one general respect, the present disclosure is directed to a system for determining a classifier to discriminate between two classes. In one embodiment, the system is used by an object detection program, where the classifier detects the presence of a 3D (three dimensional) object in a 2D (two-dimensional) image. According to this embodiment, the classifier includes a cascade of sub-classifiers where each sub-classifier is based on a ratio of Bayesian networks. Construction of each sub-classifier involves a candidate coefficient-subset creation module, a feature creation module for use in representation of unconditional distributions, a probability estimation module, an evaluation module, a coefficient-subset selection module, a Bayesian network connectivity creation module, a feature creation module for use in representation of conditional distributions, a conditional probability estimation module, a detection threshold determination module, and a non-object example selection module. 

[0017] The transform coefficients are the result of a wavelet transform operation performed on a two-dimensional (2D) digitized image where the 2D image may be subject to lighting correction and normalization. Computing the transform generates a plurality of transform coefficients, wherein each transform coefficient represents corresponding visual information from the 2D image that is localized in space, frequency, and orientation. The candidate coefficient-subset creation module may create a plurality of candidate subsets of coefficients. The feature creation module for unconditional distributions may assign a function mapping the values of each subset to a discrete valued variable. The probability estimation module will estimate probability distributions over each feature and coefficient for each class. The evaluation module evaluates the probability of each of a set of images on each probability distribution. The coefficient subset selection module will select a set of the candidate subsets. The Bayesian network connectivity creation module creates a Bayesian network graph used by the Bayesian networks for each of the two classes (object and non-object). This graph entails the dependencies and independencies resulting from the selected subsets. Another feature selection module may represent the variables at each Bayesian network node by a pair of discrete valued functions. A probability estimation module may estimate the probability distribution for each conditional probability distribution in each Bayesian Network. A non-object example selection module actively selects non-object examples for the next stage from a large database of images. 

[0018] In one embodiment, the system according to the present disclosure automatically learns the following aspects of the classifier from labeled training data: the Bayesian network graph, the features computed at each node in the Bayesian network, and the conditional probability distributions over each node in the network, thereby eliminating the need for a human to select these parameters, which, as previously described, is highly subject to error. 

[0019] In another general respect, the present disclosure is directed to a method for designing a discrete-valued variable representation at each node in a Bayesian network by a two-stage process of tree-structure vector quantization where the first stage constructs a tree over the conditioning variables and the second stage continues construction of the tree over the conditioned variables. 

[0020] In a further general respect, the present disclosure is directed to a method for estimating the conditional probability distribution at each node in a Bayesian network by a process whereby a classifier is formed as the ratio of the classifiers for the two classes (object and non-object) and the probabilities of this classifier are estimated through an iterative AdaBoost procedure. 

[0021] In a further embodiment, the present disclosure is directed to a method of finding a Bayesian Network Graph by first finding a restricted Bayesian Network of two layers, where the parents of the second layer nodes are modeled as statistically independent and where the restricted Bayesian Network is chosen using criterion of area underneath ROC curve. 

[0022] In a further general respect, the present disclosure is directed to a method of classifying two images as either belonging to the same class or to different classes. For example, in case of face recognition, a classifier according to the present disclosure may be employed on the two input images to determine whether the two given images are of the same person or not. 

[0023] In one embodiment, the present disclosure contemplates a method, which comprises: receiving a digitized version of a two-dimensional (2D) image containing a 2D representation of a three-dimensional (3D) object; obtaining visual information from the digitized version of the 2D image; and classifying the 2D Image based on a ratio of a plurality of graphical probability models using the visual information. The present disclosure also contemplates a computer-based system that implements this method, and a computer readable data storage medium that stores the necessary program code to enable a computer to perform this method. 

[0024] In another embodiment, the present disclosure contemplates a method of providing assistance in detecting the presence of a 3D object in a 2D image containing a 2D representation of the 3D object. The method comprises: receiving a digitized version of the 2D image from a client site and over a communication network; determining a location of the 3D object in the 2D image using a Bayesian network-based classifier, wherein the classifier is configured to analyze the 2D image based on a ratio of a plurality of Bayesian networks; and sending a notification of the location of the 3D object to the client site over the communication network. The present disclosure also contemplates a computer system configured to perform such a method. 

[0025] In a still further embodiment, the present disclosure contemplates a method of generating a classifier. The method comprises: computing a wavelet transform of each of a plurality of 2D images, wherein each the wavelet transform generates a corresponding plurality of transform coefficients; creating a plurality of candidate subsets of the transform coefficients; selecting a group of candidate subsets from the plurality of candidate subsets; and constructing the classifier based on a ratio of a plurality of Bayesian networks using the group of candidate subsets. The present disclosure also contemplates a computer-based system that implements such a method, and a computer readable data storage medium that stores the necessary program code to enable a computer to perform this method.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 

[0064] Reference will now be made in detail to certain embodiments of the present disclosure, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying figures. It is to be understood that the figures and descriptions of the present disclosure included herein illustrate and describe elements that are of particular relevance to the present disclosure, while eliminating for the sake of clarity, other elements found in typical image processing or image detection systems. It is noted at the outset that the terms "connected", "connecting," "electrically connected," "in communication with," etc., are used interchangeably herein to generally refer to the condition of being electrically connected or being in electrical communication. Furthermore, the term "sub-classifier" is used hereinbelow to refer to a classifier (in a sequence of classifiers that constitute an "overall" classifier) at a particular stage of classification. 

[0065] FIG. 2 illustrates an embodiment of a generalized operational flow for the object detection program according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The object detection program (simply, the "object detector" or "object finder") is represented by the block 18. A digital image 16 is a typical input to the object detector 18, which operates on the image 16 and generates a list of object locations and orientations (block 20) for the 3D objects represented in the 2D image 16. It is noted that the terms "image" and "digital image" are used interchangeably hereinbelow. However, both of these terms are used to refer to a 2D image (e.g., a photograph) containing two-dimensional representations of one or more 3D objects (e.g., human faces, cars, etc.). In one embodiment, as discussed hereinbelow in more detail, the object finder 18 may place object markers 52 (FIG. 5) on each object detected in the input image 16 by the object finder 18. The input image may be an image file digitized in one of many possible formats including, for example, a BMP (bitmap) file format, a PGM (Portable Grayscale bitMap graphics) file format, a JPG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) file format, or any other suitable graphic file format. In a digitized image, each pixel is represented as a set of one or more bytes corresponding to a numerical representation (e.g., a floating point number) of the light intensity measured by a camera at the sensing site. The input image may be gray-scale, i.e., measuring light intensity over one range of wavelength, or color, making multiple measurements of light intensity over separate ranges of wavelength. 

[0066] FIG. 3 depicts an exemplary setup to utilize the object detector program 18 according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. An object finder terminal or computer 22 may execute or "run" the object finder program application 18 when instructed by a user. The digitized image 16 may first be displayed on the computer terminal or monitor display screen and, after application of the object finder program 18, a marked-up version of the input image (e.g., picture slide 50 in FIG. 5) may be displayed on the display screen of the object finder terminal 22. The program code for the object finder program application 18 may be stored on a portable data storage medium, e.g., a floppy diskette 24, a compact disc 26, a data cartridge tape (not shown) or any other magnetic, solid state, or optical data storage medium. The object finder terminal 22 may include appropriate disk drives to receive the portable data storage medium and to read the program code stored thereon, thereby facilitating execution of the object finder software. The object finder software 18, upon execution by a processor of the computer 22, may cause the computer 22 to perform a variety of data processing and display tasks including, for example, analysis and processing of the input image 16, display of a marked-up version of the input image 16 (e.g., slide 50 in FIG. 5) identifying locations and orientations of one or more 3D objects in the input image 16 detected by the object finder 18, transmission of the marked-up version of the input image 16 to a remote computer site 28 (discussed in more detail hereinbelow), transmission of a list of object identities, locations and, orientations for the 3D objects represented in the 2D image to a remote computer site 28 (discussed in more detail hereinbelow) etc. 

[0067] As illustrated in FIG. 3, in one embodiment, the object finder terminal 22 may be remotely accessible from a client computer site 28 via a communication network 30. In one embodiment, the communication network 30 may be an Ethernet LAN (local area network) connecting all the computers within a facility, e.g., a university research laboratory or a corporate data processing center. In that case, the object finder terminal 22 and the client computer 28 may be physically located at the same site, e.g., a university research laboratory or a photo processing facility. In alternative embodiments, the communication network 30 may include, independently or in combination, any of the present or future wireline or wireless data communication networks, e.g., the Internet, the PSTN (public switched telephone network), a cellular telephone network, a WAN (wide area network), a satellite-based communication link, a MAN (metropolitan area network) etc. 

[0068] The object finder terminal 22 may be, e.g., a personal computer (PC), a laptop computer, a workstation, a minicomputer, a mainframe, a handheld computer, a small computing device, a graphics workstation, or a computer chip embedded as part of a machine or mechanism (e.g., a computer chip embedded in a digital camera, in a traffic control device, etc.). Similarly, the computer (not shown) at the remote client site 28 may also be capable of viewing and manipulating digital image files and digital lists of object identities, locations and, orientations for the 3D objects represented in the 2D image transmitted by the object finder terminal 22. In one embodiment, as noted hereinbefore, the client computer site 28 may also include the object finder terminal 22, which can function as a server computer and can be accessed by other computers at the client site 28 via a LAN. Each computer--the object finder terminal 22 and the remote computer (not shown) at the client site 28--may include requisite data storage capability in the form of one or more volatile and non-volatile memory modules. The memory modules may include RAM (random access memory), ROM (read only memory) and HDD (hard disk drive) storage. Memory storage is desirable in view of sophisticated image processing and statistical analysis performed by the object finder terminal 22 as part of the object detection process. 

[0069] Before discussing how the object detection process is performed by the object detector software 18, it is noted that the arrangement depicted in FIG. 3 may be used to provide a commercial, network-based object detection service that may perform customer-requested object detection in real time or near real time. For example, the object finder program 18 at the computer 22 may be configured to detect human faces and then human eyes in photographs or pictures remotely submitted to it over the communication network 30 (e.g., the Internet) by an operator at the client site 28. The client site 28 may be a photo processing facility specializing in removal of "red eyes" from photographs or in color balancing of color photographs. In that case, the object finder terminal 22 may first automatically detect all human faces and then all human eyes in the photographs submitted and send the detection results to the client computer site 28, which can then automatically remove the red spots on the faces pointed out by the object finder program 18. Thus, the whole process can be automated. As another example, the object finder terminal 22 may be a web server running the object finder software application 18. The client site 28 may be in the business of providing commercial image databases. The client site 28 may automatically search and index images on the World Wide Web as requested by its customers. The computer at the client site 28 may "surf" the web and automatically send a set of images or photographs to the object finder terminal 22 for further processing. The object finder terminal 22, in turn, may process the received images or photographs and automatically generate a description of the content of each received image or photograph. The depth of image content analysis may depend on the capacity of the object finder software 18, i.e., the types of 3D objects (e.g., human faces, cars, trees, etc.) the object finder 18 is capable of detecting. The results of image analysis may then be transmitted back to the sender computer at the client site 28. As a further example, a face detector may be used as a system to track attention and gaze of customers in a retail setting whereby the face detector automatically determines the locations and direction of each person's head and can infer what items the person is looking at. Such behavior can then be automatically logged to construct a record of how often items are viewed by customers and related to records of purchase for the same items. 

[0070] It is noted that the owner or operator of the object finder terminal 22 may commercially offer a network-based object finding service, as illustrated by the arrangement in FIG. 3, to various individuals, corporations, or other facilities on a fixed-fee basis, on a per-operation basis or on any other payment plan mutually convenient to the service provider and the service recipient. 

Object Finding Using a Classifier 

[0071] A primary component of the object finder 18 is a classifier or detector. FIG. 4A illustrates an "overall" classifier (or detector) 34 according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. It is discussed hereinbelow that this "overall" classifier 34 is constructed of a sequence of classifiers, where each such classifier in the sequence is referred to hereinbelow interchangeably as a "sub-classifier" or simply a "classifier". Thus, although the same term "classifier" is used below to refer to the "overall" classifier 34 and one of its constituent parts (or a "sub-classifier"), it is observed that which "classifier" is referred to at any given point in discussion will be evident from the context of discussion. The input to the classifier 34 is a fixed-size window 32 sampled from an input image 16. The classifier 34 operates on the fixed size image input 32 and makes a decision whether the object is present in the input window 32. The decision can be a binary one in the sense that the output of the classifier 34 represents only two values-either the object is present or the object is not present, or a probabilistic one indicating a probability from 0 to 1 (or over another scale) indicating the probability that the object is present. In one embodiment, the classifier only identifies the object's presence when it occurs at a pre-specified range of size and alignment within the window. It is noted that lighting correction (discussed in detail later hereinbelow) may be necessary to compensate for differences in lighting. In one embodiment, a lighting correction process 36 precedes evaluation by the classifier 34 as illustrated in FIG. 4B. 

[0072] As noted hereinbefore, a challenge in object detection is the amount of variation in visual appearance, e.g., faces vary from person to person, with varying facial expression, lighting, position and size within the classification window, etc., as shown in FIGS. 1A-1C. The classifier 34 in FIGS. 4A-4B may use statistical modeling to account for this variation. 

[0073] In one embodiment, two statistical distributions are part of each classifier--the statistics of the appearance of the given object in the image window 32, P(image-window|.omega..sub.1) where .omega..sub.1=object, and the statistics of the visual appearance of the rest of the visual world, which are identified by the "non-object" class, P(image-window|.omega..sub.2), where .omega.2=non-object. The specification of these distributions will be described hereinbelow under the "Classifier Design" section. The classifier 34 may combine these two conditional probability distributions in a likelihood ratio test. Thus, the classifier 34 (or the "overall" classifier) may compute the classification decision by retrieving the probabilities associated with the given input image window 32, P(image-window|.omega..sub.1) and P(image-window|.omega..sub.2), and using the log likelihood ratio test given in equation (1) below: 

H ( image_window ) = log P ( image_window | .omega. 1 ) P ( image_window | .omega. 2 ) > .lamda. where , ( .lamda. = log P ( .omega. 2 ) P ( .omega. 1 ) ) ( 1 ) ##EQU00001## 

If the log likelihood ratio (the left side in equation (1)) is greater than the right side (.lamda.), the classifier 34 may decide that the object is present. Here, ".lamda." represents the logarithm of the ratio of prior probabilities (determined off-line as discussed later hereinbelow). Often, prior probabilties are difficult to determine, therefore, by writing the decision rule this way (i.e., as in the equation-1, all information concerning the prior probabilities may be combined into one term ".lamda.". 

[0074] The term ".lamda." can be viewed as a threshold controlling the sensitivity of a classifier (e.g., the classifier 34). There are two types of errors a classifier can make. It can miss the object (a false negative) or it can mistake something else for the object (a false positive)(such as a cloud pattern for a human face). These two types of errors are not mutually exclusive. The ".lamda." controls the trade-off between these forms of error. Setting ".lamda." to a low value makes the classifier more sensitive and reduces the number of false negatives, but increases the number of false positives. Conversely, increasing the value of ".lamda." reduces the number of false positives, but increases the number of false negatives. Therefore, depending on the needs of a given application, a designer can choose ".lamda." empirically to achieve a desirable compromise between the rates of false positives and false negatives. 

[0075] It is noted that the log likelihood ratio test given in equation-1 is equivalent to Bayes decision rule (i.e., the maximum a posteriori (MAP) decision rule) and will be optimal if the representations for P(image-window|object) and P(image-window|non-object) are accurate. The functional forms that may be chosen to approximate these distributions are discussed later hereinbelow under the "Classifier Design" section. 

[0076] FIG. 8A depicts the general object detection approach used by the object detector program 18 according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. The object detector must apply the classifier 34 repeatedly to original image 16 at regularly spaced (and, usually overlapping) positions of the rectangular image window 32 as shown in FIG. 8A. The process makes it possible for the object detector 18 to detect instances of the object at any position within an image. Then, to be able to detect the object at any size, the object detector program 18 may iteratively resize the input image and re-apply the classifier in the same fashion to each resized image 62 and 64, as illustrated in FIG. 8A. The illustrations in FIG. 8A show an exhaustive left-to-right, row-by-row scanning of the input image (and two of its scaled versions 62, 64) using the rectangular window 32. It is noted that the size of the rectangular image window 32 may remain fixed throughout the whole detection process. The size of the image window 32 may be empirically selected based on a number of factors including, for example, object shape, desired accuracy or resolution, resulting computational complexity, efficiency of program execution, etc. In one embodiment, the size of the rectangular window is 32.times.24 pixels. 

[0077] A classifier may be specialized not only in object size and alignment, but also object orientation. In one embodiment shown in FIG. 5, the object detector 18 uses a view-based approach with multiple classifiers that are each specialized to a specific orientation of the object as described and illustrated with respect to FIG. 6. Thus, a predetermined number of view-based classifiers may be applied in parallel to the input image 16 to find corresponding object orientations. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 6, there are "m" view-based classifiers (three of which 37, 38, and 40 are shown in FIG. 6). Each of the view-based classifiers is designed to detect one orientation of a particular object (e.g., a human face). Blocks 37, 38, and 40 represent view-based classifiers designed to detect object orientations 1, 2, . . . , m. The results of the application of the view-based classifiers are then combined at block 42. The combined output indicates specific 3D objects (e.g., human faces) present in the input 2D image. 

[0078] It is noted that although the following discussion illustrates application of the object detector program 18 to detect human faces and cars in photographs or other images, that discussion is for illustrative purpose only. It can be easily evident to one of ordinary skill in the art that the object detector program 18 of the present disclosure may be trained or modified to detect different other objects (e.g., shopping cans, faces of cats, helicopters, etc.) as well. 

[0079] FIG. 5 is a real-life illustration of the object classification approach outlined in FIG. 6. As noted hereinbefore, each view-based classifier (e.g., the classifiers 37, 38, and 40 in FIG. 6) is specialized to detect a specific orientation of a given object--i.e., the object (e.g., a human face, or a car) that the view-based classifier is trained to detect. As illustrated in FIG. 5, for example, one classifier may be specialized to detect right profile views of faces as shown by the object marker 52 (generated by the classifier upon detecting the corresponding object orientation) in the picture slide 44. The picture slide 44 may thus represent the result obtained at block 37 in FIG. 6. Similarly, a different view-based classifier may be specialized to detect frontal views as illustrated by the marked-up version of the picture slide 46 in FIG. 5 (corresponding, for example, to block 38 in FIG. 5). Finally, another classifier may be configured to detect left profile views of human faces as illustrated by the marked-up version of the picture slide 48 in FIG. 5 (corresponding, for example, to block 40 in FIG. 5). Each picture slide shows object markers 52 placed at appropriate orientations of human faces detected by corresponding classifiers. These view-based classifiers are applied to the input image 16 in parallel and their results are then combined as shown by the final picture slide 50 in FIG. 5 (corresponding, for example, to the block 42 in FIG. 6). If there are multiple detections at the same or adjacent locations, the object detector 18 may choose the strongest detection. For example, in FIG. 5, picture slides 46 and 48 represent multiple detections (frontal face detection and left-hand side view detection) for the female face illustrated therein. In that event, the final combined output (in slide 50) may represent the strongest detection--i.e., the frontal face detection in slide 46. The object detector 18 may thus find orientations and locations of multiple objects (e.g., several human faces) in an image. 

[0080] FIG. 7 shows an example of different orientations for human faces and cars that the object detector program 18 may be configured to model. The number of orientations to model for each object (e.g., a human face or a car) may be empirically determined. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 7, two view-based classifiers--frontal (54A) and right profile (54B)--are used to detect front and right profiles of human faces. To detect left-profile faces (as, for example, illustrated in the picture slide 48 in FIG. 5), the right profile classifier 54B may be applied to a mirror-reversed input image. For cars, eight classifiers--one frontal classifier 56A and seven right-side classifiers 56B-56H--may be used as shown in FIG. 7. Again, the left side views (of cars) may be detected by running the seven right-side classifiers (56B-56H) on mirror-reversed images. It is noted that the numerals 54A-54B and 56A-56H are used hereinbelow to represent corresponding view-based classifiers for ease of description. 

Searching for the Object Using a Classifier 

[0081] As mentioned hereinbefore, the detector 18 has to scan this classifier 34 across the image in position and scale in order to find instances of an object as shown in FIG. 8A. This process applied directly, however, can consume a great amount of computational time. In one embodiment, several computational techniques and heuristic strategies, described hereinbelow, are employed to reduce the amount of computation. 

[0082] It is efficient to do as little computation as possible each time the detector 18 evaluates a classifier 34 at a candidate window 32 position. In particular, a partial evaluation of the classifier (equation (3) below) may be sufficient to accurately decide that a candidate belongs to the non-object class. According to one embodiment of the present disclosure, for each scaled version of the input image, (for example, versions 62 and 64 in FIG. 8A), the detector 18 may be applied in a cascade of sequential stages of partial evaluation, where each stage performs a partial evaluation of the classifier. Each of these stages of evaluation can be considered a sub-classifier. Each such sub-classifier (in equation (2) below) forms a representation of the log-likelihood ratio given hereinbefore by equation (1): 

h i ( image_window ) = log P i ( image_window | .omega. 1 ) P i ( image_window | .omega. 2 ) ( 2 ) ##EQU00002## 

It is noted that the functional forms chosen to approximate the distributions in equation (2) are discussed hereinbelow under the "Classifier Design" section. Together, the sum of the sub-classifiers from all of the stages of a classifier may constitute the "overall" classifier as given by equation (1) and also represented below in equation (3). 

H ( image_window ) = i = 1 n h i ( image_window ) ( 3 ) ##EQU00003## 

Turning to FIG. 9 (discussed later hereinbelow), in one embodiment, the set of image window 32 locations to be evaluated by each classifier stage may be determined at block 84. The set of image window 32 locations to be evaluated can initially be a set of all possible image window 32 locations. The criterion for updating the set of image window 32 locations to be evaluated may be the current total log-likelihood ratio corresponding to each location. Locations with a current total-log-likelihood ratio below a predetermined threshold may be dropped from the set of image window 32 locations to be evaluated. Thus the number of candidate locations to be evaluated may be reduced at each successive iteration of this process. 

[0083] It is noted that a cascade evaluation strategy using equations (2) and (3) can be a many step process, where a partial evaluation of equation (3) can be done incrementally. After evaluating each sub-classifier (e.g., sub-classifier h.sub.1) or a group of sub-classifiers (e.g., sub-classifiers h.sub.1, h.sub.2, and h.sub.3), the classifier may compute a partial sum of terms in equation (3). After the computation of the k.sup.th sub-classifier, this sum would be given by: 

H ( image - window ) = i = 1 k h i ( image - window ) ( 4 ) ##EQU00004## 

After each sub-classifier evaluation is completed, the classifier may apply a threshold, .lamda..sub.k, to the partial sum in equation (4) and remove additional candidates (i.e., parts of the image being searched) from further consideration as shown and discussed hereinbelow. Thus, the cascade evaluation strategy focuses on sub-classifier-by-sub-classifier analysis and builds on earlier computations to generate the final result. 

[0084] The threshold for the log-likelihood at each stage of classification may be pre-determined by a process of evaluating the current stages of the classifier on the cross-validation images (block 165 in FIG. 17B discussed later hereinbelow). Block 165 may set this threshold to match a specified performance metric such as, for example, correct detection of 95% of the pre-labeled instances of the object (e.g., a human face, or a car, etc.). 

[0085] As described earlier with respect to FIG. 8A, the object detector 18 may apply the classifier 34 repeatedly to original image 16 at regularly spaced (and, usually overlapping) positions of this rectangular image window 32 and iteratively re-apply the classifier in the same fashion to each resized image 62 and 64. The step size, .delta., for moving this window in position (FIG. 8B) and the step size, .gamma., for scaling the window in size (FIG. 8C) may influence the speed of this process. The original image 16 and its scaled version 16' (obtained by scaling the original image 16 by the step size ".gamma.") are illustrated in FIG. 8C. Bigger step sizes (.gamma., .delta.) may reduce the amount of times the classifier must be evaluated and reduce overall computation time. However, a trade-off is that the classifier 34 (FIGS. 4A, 4B) must be able to accurately classify the presence of the object over a greater range of variation in the size and position of the object as illustrated in FIG. 8D, where variations in object position (step size ".delta.") and scale (step size ".gamma.") are illustrated for a given object image window 32 of 24.times.32 pixels. 

[0086] According to one embodiment of the present disclosure, the early stages of evaluation differ from the later stages in the positional spacing (".delta." in FIG. 8B) of the evaluation sites. Early stages may use a coarse spacing, for example, 4 pixels in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions, between evaluation sites. Whereas, the later stages may use a finer spacing, e.g., spacing of 2 pixels, and the last stages may use a spacing of 1 pixel. This evaluation strategy could be thought of as a "coarse-to-fine" strategy whereby the early stages evaluate the image at coarse resolution and the later stages evaluate it at a finer resolution. In this strategy, the early stages can quickly remove much of the image from consideration and do so quickly by evaluating the image at a coarse spacing. The later stages can then evaluate the remaining sites by using a more discriminative classifier where it does not represent as much invariance in object position (see, for example, the finer evaluation illustrated in FIG. 8D). 

[0087] In one embodiment, an evaluation strategy may use a multi-resolution representation of the input image based on a wavelet transform to achieve a coarse-to-fine search method. In this embodiment, the input variables are wavelet coefficients, generated by applying 5/3 or 4/4 symmetric filter banks to the input pixels. In one embodiment, the coefficients of a symmetric 4/4 filter bank are (1.0, 3.0, 3.0, 1.0) for the low-pass filter and (-1.0, -3.0, 3.0, 1,0) for the high pass filter. In another embodiment, the coefficients of 5/3 filter bank are (-1.0, 2.0, 6.0, 2.0, -1.0) for the low pass filter and (2.0, -4.0, 2.0) for the high-pass filter. Filter-bank implementation for any filter-pair is discussed in G. Strang and T. Nguyen, "Wavelets and Filter Banks", Wellesley-Cambridge Press, 1997, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. 

[0088] FIG. 10 shows an exemplary set of subbands 60A-60D and 62A-62C produced by a wavelet transform using a 2 (two) level decomposition of an input image. The wavelet transform organizes the input image into subbands that are localized in orientation and frequency. For the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 10, a 4/4 filter-bank (not shown) may produce 7 (seven) subbands--four subbands 60A-60D at level-2 and three subbands 62A-62C at level-1. Within each subband, each wavelet transform coefficient 66 (FIG. 11) is spatially localized. It is noted that in terms of orientation, the term "LH" in FIG. 10 denotes low-pass filtering in the horizontal direction and high-pass filtering in the vertical direction, i.e., representation of horizontal features, such as, for example, human lips, eyelids, etc. Similarly, the term "HL" may denote high-pass filtering in the horizontal direction and low-pass filtering in the vertical direction, i.e., representation of vertical features, such as, for example, a human nose. Thus, vertical subbands (LH) may be considered as representing horizontal features of an object, whereas the horizontal subbands (HL) may be considered as representing vertical features. Finally, the terms "HH" may denote high-pass filtering in both horizontal and vertical directions, and "LL" may denote low-pass filtering in both horizontal and vertical directions. 

[0089] FIG. 11 depicts an input window 32 and its two level wavelet transform representation 64 generated by a symmetric 4/4 filter bank (not shown). Seven subbands (similar to those shown in FIG. 10) are visible on the wavelet decomposition 64. The wavelet transform coefficients 66 are also shown in FIG. 11. The coefficients 66, as discussed above, are spatially localized within appropriate subbands. It is noted that each level in a wavelet transform 64 represents a lower octave of frequencies. Thus, a coefficient in level-2 (i.e., subbands 60A-60D in FIG. 10) describes 4 (four) times the area of a coefficient in level-1 (i.e., subbands 62A-62C in FIG. 10). In other words, the wavelet representation 64 shows a gradation of details (of the input image) with level-2 coefficients representing coarse details and level-1 coefficients representing finer details. 

[0090] In one embodiment a wavelet transform is generated by a polyphase filter bank (not shown) or other suitable computational method (e.g., "lifting") applied to the input image 16 and each scaled version of the input image (e.g., versions 62 and 64 shown in FIG. 8A), as described in the Strang and Nguyen article mentioned above. 

[0091] In one embodiment, each wavelet transform may consist of two (2) or more levels (see, for example, FIG. 10 for a two level representation). The wavelet transform representation may be generated by the process shown in FIG. 12A. In this process, an input image 16 (or its scaled version) is first transformed to a level-1 transform. The LL subband of level-1 is then expanded to generate the level-2. If a third level or more levels are desired, each level is generated from the LL subband of the level that preceded it. This embodiment of FIG. 12A is referred to hereinbelow as a "critically sampled" wavelet transform. 

[0092] A fully overcomplete wavelet transform is a redundant version of the ordinary (critically sampled) wavelet transform. In the overcomplete wavelet transform of a 2D input, four (4) redundant "phases" are generated at each stage in a process illustrated in FIG. 12C as compared with one phase in the critically sampled case of FIG. 12A. Each phase--the even-even (EE) phase, the even-odd (EO) phase, the odd-even (OE) phase, and the odd-odd (OO) phase--corresponds to a positional shift of the input. For example, the odd-odd phase of level-1 corresponds to the wavelet transform of the input image shifted by one pixel in both the horizontal and vertical directions. If this transform in FIG. 12C is thought of as a tree, any branch (or path) starting at the input image 16 and terminating in level-2 could be thought of as a redundant wavelet transform. For example, the combination of level-1 OO and the level-2 OO (generated from level-1 OO) would be one redundant wavelet transform corresponding to the critically sampled wavelet transform of the input shifted by 3 pixels in both directions. In the representation of FIG. 12C there are 16 such redundant transforms (at level-2). 

[0093] A critically-sampled two level wavelet transform (FIG. 12A) is shift-invariant only in shifts that are multiples of "4". A fully overcomplete wavelet transform (FIG. 12C) is shift invariant for shifts that are a multiple of "1". An intermediate representation that may be referred to as a "partially overcomplete" wavelet transform of the scaled input image computes a representation that is shift-invariant in multiples of "2". In particular, this representation computes the EE phase (critically sampled and not overcomplete generation of level-1) at level-1 and then generates an overcomplete representation of level-2 from the level-1 EE phase producing level-2 EE, level-2 EO, level-2 OE, and level-2 OO phases as shown in FIG. 12B. 

[0094] A partially overcomplete (FIG. 12B) and a critically sampled (FIG. 12A) transforms are contained within a fully overcomplete transform (FIG. 12C). In FIG. 12C, the critically sampled transform is given by the left most branch consisting of level-1 EE and level-2 EE phases. The partially overcomplete transform has 4 redundant phases corresponding to the 4 left most branches given by (level-1 BE, level-2 EE), (level-1 BE, level-2 OE), (level-1 EE, level-2 EO), (level-1 EE, level-2 OO). 

[0095] In order to effectively use a classifier with a built-in shift invariance of 1 pixel (.delta.=0.5 in FIG. 8B), the classifier should preferably be evaluated with respect to fully overcomplete wavelet transform during detection. This amount of shift invariance corresponds to evaluation sites that are spaced by increments of 1 pixels apart in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Likewise, a classifier with a shift-invariance of 2'pixels should preferably be evaluated with respect to a partially overcomplete or fully complete wavelet transform. This amount of shift-invariance corresponds to spacing the evaluation sites 2 pixels apart. A classifier with shift-invariance of 4 pixels can be evaluated with respect to critically-sampled, partially overcomplete, or fully overcomplete transform. Each phase of a partially or fully overcomplete transform is evaluated separately as if it were a separate image. Referring in this context to FIG. 9, the set of windows to be evaluated for all phases is determined at block 74 (by, for example, a process of comparing partial evaluation of equation-3 to a threshold .lamda..sub.k as discussed hereinbefore) and then the input windows are evaluated for each of these phases sequentially (block 84). For example, for the partially overcomplete expansion, block 84 in FIG. 9 is repeated for the 4 phases, whereas for the fully overcomplete transform, block 84 in FIG. 9 is repeated for 16 phases. 

[0096] In one embodiment with four stages, the first two stages use a critically sampled wavelet transform and a classifier designed with shift invariance of 4 pixels and the last three stages use a partially overcomplete wavelet transform and a classifier designed with a shift-invariance of 2 pixels. This evaluation strategy could be thought of as a "coarse-to-fine" strategy whereby the early stages evaluate the image at coarse resolution and the later stages evaluate it at a finer resolution. 

[0097] In an alternative embodiment, a 5.sup.th stage may use a fully overcomplete wavelet transform and a classifier designed with a shift-invariance of 1 giving a more pronounced progression from coarse to fine. In this embodiment, the image window 32 may not directly sample the scaled image as implied by FIG. 4A, but rather it may sample wavelet coefficients generated from the input image (e.g., at block 74 in FIG. 9). In the case where some form of overcomplete expansion is used, the window 32 may select coefficients from one wavelet transform derived from the overcomplete (or semi-overcomplete) wavelet transform. The image window 32 may select the coefficients within this transform that spatially correspond to the position of the image window within the image or its scaled version 16' as shown in FIG. 13A. Note that one image window corresponds to a collection of blocks of wavelet coefficients from each wavelet subband. This choosing of coefficients is equivalent to first selecting the window in the original image 16 (or its scaled version 16') and then taking the wavelet transform of the image window. 

[0098] Evaluation sites (e.g., the sites 67 in FIG. 13A) may be specified by the center of the window 32 with respect to the chosen wavelet transform's second level. Each coefficient in the level-2 LL band (see, e.g., FIG. 10) corresponds to a center of a potential evaluation site as shown in FIG. 3A. The set of all possible evaluation sites for this phase of the wavelet transform corresponds to the set of windows placed at each such wavelet coefficient. It is noted that such image window 32 locations may be partially overlapping as shown in FIG. 13B. 

[0099] In FIG. 9, at block 74, the object detector program 18 may evaluate a single stage, h.sub.i, for each member of a set of image window 32 locations to be evaluated. In one embodiment, the object detector 18 can keep, for each of the set of image window 32 locations to be evaluated, a partial calculation of equation (4) that may be referred to as a total log-likelihood. It is noted that each term of equation (4) may correspond to the log-likelihood generated by the application of a sub-classifier to an image-window location. The partial calculation of equation (4), or total log-likelihood, contains terms resulting from sub-classifiers already applied to the location. 

[0100] As described hereinbefore, the system assigns log-likelihood to each evaluation site where each site corresponds to a window centered at a coefficient location in level 2 of the wavelet transform. Since evaluation may be repeated over different phases of the wavelet transform (i.e., small positional shifts), these evaluations must be combined (summed) and resolved with respect to a common coordinate frame at a higher resolution. In one embodiment, these log-likelihoods are resolved by re-expressing them in a representation at the resolution of the original image. Block 76 in FIG. 9 denotes propagation of the log-likelihood from level 2 of the wavelet transform to the resolution of the original image. Note that level 2 of the wavelet transform has 1/4th the resolution of the original image. Representation of log-likelihood at image resolution allows the combination of results computed at different phases as indicated by the program loop at decision block 78 in FIG. 9. The manner of propagation depends on the amount of shift-invariance (1, 2, or 4) trained into the classifier, i.e., a shift invariance of 4 implies that object's center location falls within a 4.times.4 region; a shift invariance of 2 implies the location is within a 2.times.2 region, etc. FIGS. 14A-14E illustrate propagation for different amounts of shift invariance and different phases in one dimension of wavelet transform. For example, shift invariance of 4 leads to a propagation of 4 sites in the original image as shown in the diagrams 210 and 212 in FIGS. 14A and 14B, respectively, shift invariance of 2 leads to propagation of 2 sites as illustrated by diagrams 214 and 216 in FIGS. 14C and 14D, respectively, and shift-invariance of 1 leads to propagation of one site as shown in the diagram 218 in FIG. 14E. Also, observe that differences in phase correspond to positional offsets of the propagation as shown by the difference between FIG. 14A and FIG. 14B, and the difference between FIGS. 14C and 14D. 

[0101] Block 72 in FIG. 9 initializes the log likelihood for the current phase of the current stage to zero for all candidate object locations for each process iteration at block 78. Instead of evaluating a single stage, the process in FIG. 16 may increment the stage pointer "i" (in f.sub.i) to evaluate other stages for each member of the set of image window locations as illustrated by the process loop including blocks 78, 82, and 84 in FIG. 9. 

[0102] In one embodiment, in the detection process of FIG. 9, the input image 16 is repeatedly reduced in size (blocks 86, 88 in FIG. 9) by a factor "f" given by: 

f = 2 ( i 4 ) , where i = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ( 5 ) ##EQU00005## 

Thus, for example, for i=2, f=1.41. Hence, the image is reduced by factor "f". In other words, the new scaled image (for i=2) is 0.71 (1/f) in size as compared to the original image (for i=0). Thus, the size (along any dimension, e.g., horizontal) of the image to be evaluated can be expressed by N=(1/f)*S, where N is the size of the input image currently evaluated by the corresponding classifier, and S is the original size of the input image. Extensive object search (as given by blocks 70, 72, 74, and 76 in FIG. 9) is continued for each scale until the scaled input image is smaller than the size of the image window 32. 

[0103] It is noted that although the input image is scaled to many values of "i" (e.g., for i=0 . . . 19), the entire wavelet transform does not always need to be computed in its entirety for each successive scale. In one embodiment, the object detector 18 "re-uses" parts of the transform in the search across scale. FIGS. 18 and 19 illustrate this process. 

[0104] As shown at block 132 in FIG. 15, the two levels of the transform need to be computed in their entirety for the first four scales (scales 0 through 3) of the input image (corresponding to i=0 . . . 3). Thus, for the first octave of search in scale (corresponding to the first four scales given by equation 5), each level of the transform is recomputed in its entirety at each scaling. However, after these first four scalings (i.e., beginning with the fifth scale (scale-4) corresponding to i=4), the object detector 18 can "reuse" parts of the transform computed at previous scalings as illustrated in FIG. 15. This is done by selecting the transform corresponding to the scaling that differs by one octave (f=2 in equation-5, i.e., four (4) scalings) from the current scaling. Thus, for example, to compute the transform for scale-i (where i.gtoreq.4 in equation-5), the transform for scale (i-4) may be utilized because the transform for scale-i (i.gtoreq.4) is related to the transform at scale (i-4) by a shift in levels. For example, the wavelet transform at scale-4 is related to that at scale-0, and the transform at scale-5 is related to that at scale-1, and so on as illustrated in FIG. 15 in case of scales 0 and 4. 

[0105] In one embodiment, to obtain the transform at scale-i (i.gtoreq.4), the object detector 18 shifts the transform for scale (i-4) by one level. That is, level-2 at scale (i-4) becomes level-1 at scale-i (for i.gtoreq.4) as shown in FIG. 15 with reference to scales 0 and 4. Therefore, the object detector 18 needs to compute only the top level (i.e., level-2) for each scale-i (i.gtoreq.4), rather than computing the entire transform (i.e., levels 1 through 2) for the new scale-i. Blocks 126 and 128 in FIG. 16 illustrate the scaling and partial re-use of the transform discussed hereinabove. As shown by the feed-back arrow at block 128 in FIG. 16, the transform re-use and extensive object search (as given by blocks 120, 122, 124, and 130 in FIG. 16) is continued for each scale until the scaled input image is smaller than the size of the image window 32 as also discussed hereinbefore with reference to FIG. 9. For example, for i=0 . . . 3, the object detector 18 may search the object at scales (i+k*4, where k.gtoreq.1). For example, for scales 0 through 3, the corresponding scales that may be searched by the object detector 18 include scales 4 through 7 (for k=1 at block 128), 8 through 11 (for k=2 at block 128), 12 through 15 (for k=3 at block 128), 16 through 19 (for k=4 at block 128), and so on until the scaled input image for a given scale is smaller than the image window size. Such an extensive scanning for each image size and image window location improves accuracy of detection by making it possible to find instances of the object over this range in position and size. 

[0106] Alternatively, if the low-pass filtering effects of the wavelet transform are not desirable, the wavelet transform can be re-computed from scratch for each scaled version of the image. 

[0107] Typically, when the object detector program 18 encounters the object (e.g., a face), it may not give one single large response (for the left side of equation-1) at one location that is greater than the threshold ".lamda." (i.e., the right side of equation-1). It may instead give a number of large responses at adjacent locations all corresponding to the same face that all exceed the detection threshold. Furthermore, multiple view-based classifiers may detect the same object at the same location. For example, FIG. 5 shows a case where the same face (the female in the foreground of the photograph) is initially detected by two of the view-based classifiers (the face detectors #2 and #3 in FIG. 5). To resolve that all such multiple "detections" (here, two detections) are caused by the same object, the following approach--which may be called "arbitration" (block 90 in FIG. 9)--may be used. First, the detection value (i.e., the left side of equation-1 or equivalently equation-3) is computed for all viewpoints and at all locations within the image and all its scalings. Then, a list composed of all the locations for which the detection value is greater than the detection threshold is formed. This list is then put in order from the detection of the greatest magnitude (i.e., for which the value of the left side of equation-1 is largest) to that of the smallest magnitude. The first entry in this list is declared a real detection. Then this entry may be compared to all others in the list. If another entry within the ordered list is within a predetermined distance (preferably, the distance may be half the radius of the image window because as the image window size is fixed, its radius is also fixed) of the first entry, it is assumed to correspond to the same object and it is discarded. After the first entry is compared to all other entries, this process repeats for the entry in the remaining list that has the largest magnitude (after the first entry and all entries matching to it have been removed); that is, this second entry is now declared to be another real detection and is compared to all other entries in the remaining list whereby any entries that are close in distance to it are discarded. This process continues until the list is exhausted. 

[0108] The object detector according to the present disclosure may provide computational advantages over the existing state of the art. In particular, it is observed that although it may take many sub-classifier evaluations to confirm the presence of the object, it can often take only a few evaluations to confirm that an object is not present. It is therefore wasteful to defer a detection decision until all the sub-classifiers have been evaluated. According to one embodiment, the object detector 18 may thus discard non-object candidates after as few sub-classifier evaluations as possible. The coarse-to-fine strategy implemented by the object detector 18, according to one embodiment, involves a sequential evaluation whereby after each sub-classifier evaluation, the object detector makes a decision about whether to conduct further evaluations or to decide that the object is not present. This strategy may be applied to the multi-resolution representation provided by the wavelet transform whereby the sub-classifier evaluations are ordered from low-resolution, computationally quick features to high-resolution, computationally intensive features. By doing so, the object detector may efficiently rule out large regions first and thereby it only has to use the more computationally intensive sub-classifiers on a much smaller number of candidates. 

[0109] Experiments have shown that the cascade search strategy discussed hereinbefore may reduce computational time by a factor of several hundreds over an exhaustive full evaluation of every possible object location in position and scale. 

Classifier Design 

[0110] Each sub-classifier (equation (2)) can be viewed as a representation of the ratio of the full joint distributions. P(image-window|object) and P(image-window|non-object). It may not be computationally feasible to represent these full joint distributions. The image window 32 may encompass several hundreds or even thousands of pixel variables. In that case, it may not be computationally feasible to represent the joint distribution of such a large number of variables without reducing the complexity of this distribution. 

[0111] Typically, for some classes of images, e.g., images of faces, it is the case that not all variables are statistically dependent on all other variables. Each variable may have strong direct statistical dependency with a small number of other variables and negligible dependency with the remaining ones. This characteristic of "sparse dependency structure" allows one to represent the probability distributions by only representing the direct dependencies among the variables. Graphical probability models, particularly Bayesian networks, may be a concise representation for capturing only the direct dependencies among a group of variables. Other graphical probability models (such as, for example, Markov Random Fields, Factor Graphs, Chain Graphs, Mixtures of Trees, etc.) in place of Bayesian networks may also be suitably employed by one skilled in the art to construct sub-classifiers as per the methodology discussed in the present disclosure. 

[0112] In one embodiment, each probability distribution in h.sub.i(image_window|.omega.) is represented by a Bayesian Network. A Bayesian network structure is a directed acyclic graph whose nodes represent random variables as described in more detail in Richard E. Neapolitan, "Learning Bayesian Networks", published by Pearson Prentice Hall (2004), the discussion of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A Bayesian network may take the following form: 

P(Image_window|.omega.)=P(x.sub.1, . . . ,x.sub.r|.omega.)=P(x.sub.1|pa.sub.x1)P(x.sub.2|pa.sub.x2) . . . P(x.sub.n|pa.sub.xn) (6) 

where the image-window 32 consists of the variables (consisting of pixels or coefficients generated by a transformation (e.g., a wavelet transform) on the pixels)(x.sub.1 . . . x.sub.r) and where pa.sub.xi denotes the parents of x.sub.i in the graph, which are a subset of the variables. For example, pa.sub.x1 may be (X.sub.5, x.sub.9, x.sub.12). 

[0113] In one embodiment, the classifier 34 can be represented as the ratio of two Bayesian network graphs (one representing P(image_window|.omega..sub.1) and the other for P(image_window|.omega..sub.2) from equation (1)) where each graph has the same connectivity. The conditional probability distributions forming each Bayesian Network (the terms on the right hand side in equation (6)) can take many functional forms. For example, they could be Gaussian models, mixture models, kernel-based non-parametric representations, etc. Also, each conditional probability may have to be of the same functional form. As described in more detail hereinafter, in one embodiment, each probability distribution in equation (6) is represented by a table. For example, consider a hypothetical probability distribution P(x.sub.1|pa.sub.x1), where pa.sub.x1={x.sub.3, x.sub.4}. Each variable can take on two possible values (0 or 1). Such a table would have eight entries corresponding to each possible combination of values. Each entry would be a probability and all 8 probabilities would stun to 1.0. 

[0114] A challenge in building a Bayesian network representation is that learning the connectivity of a Bayesian network is known to be NP complete; that is, the only guaranteed optimal solution is to construct classifiers over every possible network connectivity and explicitly compare their performance. Moreover, the number of possible connectivities is super-exponential in the number of variables. Heuristic search may be the only possible means of finding a solution. In one embodiment, the selection of the Bayesian Network connectivity is achieved by the statistical methods as described hereinbelow. 

[0115] FIG. 17A and FIG. 17B show a block diagram of a system 142 for automatically creating a Bayesian Network-based classifier for one embodiment of the present disclosure. Various blocks in FIG. 17A are illustrated in more detail in FIG. 17B with their corresponding constituent sub-blocks. The system 142 can use statistical methods to choose the Bayesian Network (BN) composing each sub-classifier stage of the object detector program. The system 142 may be implemented using a computing device such as, for example, a personal computer, a laptop computer, a workstation, a minicomputer, a mainframe, a handheld computer, a small computer device, or a supercomputer, depending upon the application requirements. 

[0116] As illustrated in FIG. 17A, the system 142 may include training images for the object class 150, training images for the non-object class 154, and cross-validation images (testing images in which the locations of the object are labeled) 152. A method to prepare training images of an object is illustrated in FIG. 18 and discussed later hereinbelow. The system modules 144, 146, 148 may be implemented as software code to be executed by a processor (not shown) of the system 142 using any suitable computer language such as, for example, Java, Ada, C or C++ using, for example, conventional or object-oriented techniques. The software code may be stored as a series of instructions or commands on a computer-readable medium, such as a random access memory (RAM), a read only memory (ROM), a magnetic medium such as a hard-drive or a floppy disk, or an optical medium such as a CD-ROM. It is observed that modules 146 and 148 in FIG. 17A are shown in detail in FIG. 17B and discussed later hereinbelow. 

[0117] The candidate subset creation module 144 may form a set of subsets (not shown), where each subset is chosen to represent a group of input variables that depend upon each other. These subsets may not be mutually exclusive. Thus, a variable can be a member of multiple subsets. The subset creation module 144 may determine the grouping into subsets by optimizing over "local" error in the log likelihood ratio function. This function assumes that every pair of variables is independent from the remaining variables. In particular, the ratio function may organize the variables into a large number of "candidate" subsets such that the "local" error measure is minimized as discussed later hereinbelow in conjunction with equation (11) and discussion of FIG. 20. This organization may restrict the final network to representing dependencies that occur only within subsets. The module 144 computes this error function using labeled object and non-object training images as inputs. 

[0118] The candidate subset selection module 146 in FIGS. 17A-17B chooses a small set of the candidate subsets created by block 144. The module 146 makes this choice by comparing "restricted Bayesian network" structures formed from combinations of the candidate subsets. For each possible combination of subsets, the restricted network may consist of two layers of nodes. Each node in the second layer corresponds to a subset and consists of the variables from this subset that do not occur in any other subsets. Any variables that co-occur among subsets become nodes in the top layer. Each such variable becomes a separate node and is parent to multiple second layer nodes representing all its subset memberships. 

[0119] In this embodiment each restricted network may be of the following form: 

P ( X 1 , , X n ) = P ( S 1 ) P ( S 2 ) P ( S r ) [ P ( X 1 ) ] a 1 [ P ( X 2 ) ] a 2 [ P ( X n ) ] a n ( 7 ) ##EQU00006## 

[0120] The variables X.sub.1, X.sub.2, etc. may be either pixels or transform coefficients. In one embodiment, they are wavelet transform coefficients. The structure in equation-7 assumes that the parents of any node in the second layer are statistically independent where S.sub.1 . . . S.sub.r are some collection of subsets of the input variables generated by the subset creation module 144. Each .alpha..sub.k corresponds to the number of occurrences of the given variable in the r subsets. For example, if variable X.sub.k occurs in 3 subsets, then .alpha..sub.k would equal 2 (to represent the occurrence of X.sub.k in 2 additional subsets). In general, the denominator in equation (7) could be thought of as a term that corrects for "over-counting"; that is, accounting for the occurrence of a variable in more than one subset. 

[0121] In the embodiment of FIG. 17A, the subset selection module 146 may search in this space of restricted networks and choose one (of the restricted networks) that minimizes global classification error as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The restricted network is estimated using labeled examples of the object (150) and non-object (154). Global classification error is computed with respect both to the training images (150, 154) and independent crass-validation images (152). It is observed here that all sets of images (either at block 150, or 152, or 154) are labeled. By restricting network structure, one can compare candidate networks at little computational cost by using pre-computed estimates and evaluations. In comparison, much less computation can be pre-computed and re-used when comparing full (unrestricted) Bayesian networks. Moreover, the cost of computing a classification error score for even one full Bayesian network can be significant. It may involve estimating conditional probability functions over the entire set of training images. Typically, high dimensional problems, such as image classification, require a large set of training examples, e.g., as many as 10.sup.6 training images. 

[0122] The Bayesian Network creation module 148 removes the independence assumption from the chosen restricted network and find a full Bayesian Network that entails all the direct dependence and independence relationships implied by the chosen set of subsets. In one embodiment, this full Bayesian network is constructed using a heuristic search designed to minimize the dimensionality of the resulting conditional probability distributions. The Bayesian Network creation module 148 may estimate the conditional probability distributions forming each Bayesian network from the labeled training images of the object and non-object. The construction of a full BN (given by blocks 144, 146, and 148 in FIG. 17A) may continue for each stage of the classifier 34 as indicated by the process loop at block 156. 

[0123] The object training images 150 are representative example images of the object (e.g., human faces or cars) that the object detector 18 is built to detect. FIG. 18 describes an embodiment of how these examples are generated. In the embodiment of FIG. 18, for each face viewpoint, about 2,000 original images are used; and for each car viewpoint, between 300 and 500 original images are used. Each of these original training images can be sized, aligned, and rotated to give the best correspondence with a prototype representing the image class (e.g., frontal faces) as indicated at block 104 in FIG. 18. The size of each such training image may be identical to the size of the classification window 32. For each original training image, approximately 400 synthetic variations of the image are generated (block 106) by altering background scenery and making small changes in aspect ratio, orientation, frequency content, and position using a random number generator. Then, at block 108, the wavelet transform of each such example (including the original image or its synthetic variation) is computed and, in block 109, a lighting correction is applied which will be discussed later hereinbelow. It is noted that increasing the number of original images and synthetic variations may increase the computational time required for the modules in the system 142 of FIGS. 17A-17B, but may also increase the accuracy of the resulting classifier. The number of original training images and the number of synthetic variations of each original image may be determined by the desired accuracy of detection, the availability of suitable training images, and limitations on the amount of time and computer resources that can be devoted to the computations among the modules in the system 142 in FIGS. 17A-17B. In one embodiment, the object training images are re-used for each stage of classifier. However, the synthetic variations of these may be different in that different random numbers may be used. 

[0124] Non-object examples 154 (FIG. 17A) may be taken from images that do not contain the object. For example, in case of the human face object, some non-object examples may include backgrounds in a public place, office architecture, etc. In one embodiment, approximately 600,000 non-object examples are used. The selection of non-object examples is described in more detail hereinafter. 

[0125] In one embodiment, each classifier stage may use a different set of training examples for the non-object class. It may be desirable to choose "non-object" examples that are most likely to be mistaken for the object to be detected (e.g., a human face or a car) as discussed in B. D. Ripley, Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks, Cambridge University Press, 1996. This concept is similar to the way support vector machines work by selecting samples near the decision boundary as discussed in V. N. Vapnik, The Nature of Statistical Learning Theory, Sprinter, 1995. The relevant disclosures of both of these publications are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. 

[0126] In one embodiment, non-object training examples (154) may be acquired at block 167 in FIG. 17B by a bootstrapping method designed to determine such samples (i.e., non-object samples that are most likely to be mistaken for the object). Bootstrapping requires that the overall classifier is trained as a sequence of classifiers, where each stage is a full classifier (or "sub-classifier") (and the overall classifier is a sum of these classifiers given by equation-3). Bootstrapping works in the following way illustrated in FIG. 19. The first stage (k=1) classifier (blocks 144, 146, and 148 in FIG. 17A) may be trained by estimating P(image_window|.omega..sub.2) using randomly drawn samples from a set of non-object images (block 175, FIG. 19). This classifier is then run over a set of images (for example, 2,500 images) that do not contain the object (block 176, FIG. 19). Block 178 in FIG. 19 selects the image windows (32) within that collection of images which give high log-likelihood (false detections or near false detections). These image windows will then be ones that "resemble" the object in the sense of stage-1 of the classifier. These non-object examples 154 are then used to train stage-2 (k=2) of the classifier. This process (i.e., the process illustrated in FIG. 19) may be repeated (block 181) to choose the non-object examples for the second stage (k=2) of the classifier 34, this time by evaluating the first two stages in combination over a set of images that do not contain the object. This process can be repeated for each successive stage (block 181). 

[0127] In one embodiment, the wavelet transform of each training example is computed (block 108 in FIG. 18) prior to compiling the set of object training images (block 150 in FIGS. 15 and 17A). The sampling of the wavelet transform depends on the shift-invariance desired as described hereinbefore. For a shift-invariance of 4, the fully overcomplete transform may be computed; for a shift-invariance of 2, the semi-overcomplete transform may be computed; and for a shift-invariance of 1, the critically-sampled transform may be computed. The fully overcomplete transform may effectively give 16 synthetic variations of the original training example where the variations correspond to positional shifts of the input as described hereinabove. Each of these 16 variants may each be treated henceforth as separate training examples and the wavelet coefficients forming each are the variables which may be decomposed into subsets. Similarly, the semi-overcomplete transform gives 4 synthetic variations, and the critically sampled transform gives one synthetic variation. 

[0128] The cross-validation images 152 (FIG. 17A) are images of realistic scenes that often contain the object. The locations of the object in these scenes are known (usually entered by hand) and used to select coefficient subsets (block 161, FIG. 17B), determine the number of adaboost iterations (block 165, FIG. 17B), determine the detection threshold (block 161, FIG. 17B), and the weight of the stage (block 161, FIG. 17B) as described hereinbelow. 

[0129] According to one embodiment, the candidate subset creation module 144 (FIG. 17A) may create a set of candidate subsets of input variables. FIG. 20 is a flowchart illustrating a process flow for the candidate coefficient-subset creation module 144 according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. The input variables to the module 144 may be pixels or variables derived from a transformation of the input pixels such as wavelet coefficients as described hereinbelow. The subset creation module 144 may form the subsets by considering two types of modeling error: not modeling the dependency between two variables or not modeling a variable altogether. The cost of these modeling errors may be evaluated in terms of their impact on the log-likelihood ratio function. Further, in one embodiment, these errors are evaluated only over pairs of input variables, (X.sub.i, X.sub.j) by assuming that each pair, (X.sub.i, X.sub.j), is independent from the remaining input variables. In particular, each error is the difference between the true log-likelihood ratio, i.e., log (P(X.sub.i, X.sub.j|.omega..sub.1)/P(X.sub.i, X.sub.j|.omega..sub.2)), and the log-likelihood ratio under the given modeling choice. An exemplary set of three possible cases may be considered with the following costs: 

C 1 ( X i , X j ) = x i .di-elect cons. S i x i .di-elect cons. S j P ( x i , x j ) abs [ log P ( x i , x l | .omega. i ) P ( x i , x j | .omega. j ) - log P ( x i | .omega. i ) P ( x j | .omega. 1 ) P ( x i | .omega. 2 ) P ( x j | .omega. 2 ) ] ( 8 ) C 2 ( X i , X j ) = x i .di-elect cons. S i x i .di-elect cons. S j P ( x i , x j ) abs [ log P ( x i , x l | .omega. i ) P ( x i , x j | .omega. j ) - log P ( x i | .omega. i ) P ( x i | .omega. 2 ) ] ( 9 ) C 2 ( X i , X j ) = x i .di-elect cons. X i x i .di-elect cons. X j P ( x i , x j ) abs [ log P ( x i , x l | .omega. i ) P ( x i , x j | .omega. j ) ] ( 10 ) ##EQU00007## 

where, C.sub.1 is the error in modeling the two variables, X.sub.i and X.sub.j, as independent; C.sub.2 is the error of removing one variable, X.sub.j, from the pair; and C.sub.3 is the error of removing both variables from the pair. Also, in the foregoing equations 8-10, the "abs[ ]" denotes an operator that gives absolute value of the parameter supplied as its operand. The error measures C.sub.1, C.sub.2, and C.sub.3 may be obtained by empirically estimating the probability distributions, P(X.sub.i, X.sub.j|.omega..sub.1) and P(X, X.sub.j|.omega..sub.2), for every pairings of variables, X.sub.i, X.sub.j. 

[0130] In the above embodiment, each of the random variables is assumed to be discrete-valued. Thus, upper case notation is used to denote the random variable and lower case notation is used to denote a particular instantiation of the variable; that is, each sum is over all possible values of the given random variable. Under these approximations, the error associated with a given choice of subsets, G=(S.sub.1, . . . ,S.sub.r), can be computed as. 

E i ( G ) = ( ? C 1 ( X i , X j ) + ? C 2 ( X i , X j ) + ? C 3 ( X i , X j ) ( 11 ) ? indicates text missing or illegible when filed ##EQU00008## 

where each S.sub.k is a subset chosen from the set of input variables, X.sub.1 . . . X.sub.n. A set of candidate subsets, G, is then sought to minimize this localized error function in equation (11). 

[0131] To find such a solution, the probability distributions, P(x.sub.i,x.sub.j|.omega..sub.1) and P(x.sub.i,x.sub.j|.omega..sub.2), may preferably be represented over pairs of variables, (x.sub.i,x.sub.j). In one embodiment, the estimate_coefficient_mean_variance_object module (block 184, FIG. 20) estimates the mean and variance of each coefficient, x.sub.i, over training examples of the object class, .omega..sub.1. The estimate_coefficient_pair_probability_object module (block 186. FIG. 20) and estimate_coefficient_pair_probability_non_object module (block 188, FIG. 20) estimate every pair P(x.sub.i,x.sub.j|.omega..sub.1) and P(x.sub.i,x.sub.j|.omega..sub.2) by quantizing each variable and estimating the probability distributions by using histograms (illustrated, for example, in FIG. 24) collected from the training examples. The estimate_coeffcient_pair_probability_object module 186 may use training examples from each object class, .omega..sub.1. On the other hand, the estimate_coefficient_pair_probability_non_object module 188 may use training examples from the object class, .omega..sub.2. In one embodiment, each variable is quantized to five levels, where the quantization levels are chosen as a function of the mean (.mu.) and standard deviation (.sigma.) of the variable with respect to the .omega..sub.1 class with thresholds at .mu.-0.7.sigma., .mu.-0.15 .sigma., .mu.+0.15.sigma., .mu.+0.7 .sigma.. Each joint distribution is represented by a histogram with 25 bins and each distribution of one variable is represented by a histogram of 5 bins. A detailed discussion of histograms is given hereinbelow with reference to FIG. 24. 

[0132] In one embodiment, the select_best_groups_with_each_coefficient module (block 190, FIG. 20) assigns the variables to n subsets using n greedy searches, where each input variable, X.sub.i, is a seed for one search. A description of "greedy search" may be found in Stuart J. Russell, Peter Norvig, "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" (second edition), Prentice-Hall, 2003, and the relevant portion of this book discussing a "greedy search" is incorporated herein by reference. The greedy searches at block 190 may guarantee that every variable is initially represented in at least one subset and, therefore, there are no errors of the form C.sub.2 or C.sub.3. Each of these greedy searches may add new variables by choosing the one that has the largest sum of C.sub.1 values formed by its pairing with all current members of the subset. Such a selection process may guarantee that the variables within any subset will have strong statistical dependency with each other. This may be a fairly reasonable way to initially optimize the error function of equation (11) because the errors due to removing a variable tend to be greater than those of removing a dependency. 

[0133] The select_final_candidate_subsets module 192 (FIG. 20) reduces the number of subsets to a smaller collection. The search performed by module 192 sequentially removes subsets until some desirable number, q, are remaining. At each step the search removes the subset that will lead to the smallest increase in modeling error. In particular, it follows from equation (11) that the error in removing a given subset, S.sub.k, is: 

? C 1 ( X i , X j ) + ? C 2 ( X i , X j ) + ? C 3 ( X i , X j ) ? indicates text missing or illegible when filed ( 12 ) ##EQU00009## 

[0134] In one embodiment the number of selected candidate subsets, q, was 200. In general, computational cost is linear in the number of candidate subsets and, therefore, does not prohibit consideration of a larger number of subsets, e.g., 1,000. Subset size is a flexible parameter that can be specified manually. Larger subsets have the potential to capture greater dependency. Larger subsets, however lead to greater dimensionality of the conditional probability distributions within the Bayesian network, and, therefore, size must be balanced against practical limits in representational power and limited training data. In one embodiment, multiple subset sizes of 4, 8, and 16 are used where an equal number of subsets of each size are chosen by the process described hereinabove. In another embodiment, a set of candidate subsets are selected (block 146 in FIG. 17A) by comparing the different reduced networks of equation (7) formed by different combinations of these subsets. The overall process for making this selection is shown in FIG. 21, which illustrates a detailed view of the sub-processes or sub-modules (158, and 194-198) that are part of the candidate subset selection module 146 in FIGS. 17A-17B. 

[0135] To form a restricted Bayesian network, equation (7) requires representation of probability distributions over all the candidate subsets: P(S.sub.1|.omega..sub.j), . . . , P(S.sub.q|.omega..sub.1) and P(S.sub.1|.omega..sub.2), . . . , P(S.sub.q|.omega..sub.2). It may not be possible to represent these distributions as full joint probability distributions because their dimensionality will be too great. Hence, a reduced representation may be desirable. In one embodiment, the create_candidate_features_from_subsets module 158 (FIGS. 17B and 21) forms a representation of each subset by a function, f.sub.i(S.sub.i), that maps values for each subset (S.sub.i) of variables to a discrete-valued variable. Computational considerations may govern the complexity of the feature functions, f.sub.i(S.sub.i). In early stages of evaluation in which many candidate windows have to be evaluated, the feature functions may be designed to be computationally efficient and restricted to a relatively small range of discrete values (for example, 10.sup.2 values). In later stages, when there are fewer windows to evaluate, the feature functions may be chosen to more discriminative and spread over a larger set of values (for example, 10.sup.4). In one embodiment, the early stages use features based on linear projection of the subset's wavelet coefficients and the later stages use features that do not use linear projection. It is noted here that, for the sake of convenience, the term "feature" is used herein interchangeably with the term "feature function." 

[0136] Each subset of variables can be represented by a linear projection to a smaller number of coefficients. For example, if twelve wavelet coefficients, w.sub.1, . . . , w.sub.12, form a given subset, they may be projected down to five coefficients, p.sub.1 . . . , p.sub.5, where each p.sub.k is given by: 

p.sub.k=.sigma..sub.k.sup.Tw 

w=(w.sub.1, . . . ,w.sub.12).sup.T (13) 

[0137] The linear projection vectors, .nu..sub.k, may be determined by several methods: principal components vectors computed from the object training set, principal components computed over the non-object training set, principal components computed over the combined object and non-object training sets. It is noted that one skilled in the art of statistics and linear algebra would recognize the process of principal component analysis or the Foley-Sammon discriminant vectors (multidimensional extension of Fisher Linear discriminant) between both classes as discussed in Foley, D. H. and Sammon, J. W., An Optimal Set of Discriminant Vectors, IEEE Transactions Computers (1975), vol. C-24, pp. 281-289, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In one embodiment, the various subbands (see, e.g., FIG. 10) may be multiplied by scalar constants prior to this computation (principal component analysis or the Foley-Sammon discriminate vectors determination) and correspondingly prior to projection on these linear vectors. In one embodiment, all 5/3 filter bank coefficients in all level-1 subbands are multiplied by 0.25 and all coefficients in all level-2 subbands are multipled by 0.0625. In another embodiment, all 4/4 filter bank coefficients in level-1 are multiplied by 0.0156 and all coefficients in level-2 are multiplied by 0.00024414. 

[0138] Each subset of projection coefficients can be represented by one discrete value that takes on a finite range of values. The one discrete value may be referred to herein as the "quantized feature value", which is represented herein by the variable, f. This transformation is achieved by quantization of the projection coefficients. Several methods of quantization may be used and their quantization thresholds may be determined by the following procedure. 

[0139] In one method, referred to herein as "scalar quantization-1", each variable is first separately quantized. The quantization boundaries may be set in terms of the mean (ti) and standard deviation (a) of the variable computed over the object training images. For example, a variable could be quantized to 5 values with the following quantization boundaries: 

d<.mu.-.sigma. 

.mu.-.sigma..ltoreq.d<.mu.-0.5.sigma. 

.mu.-0.5.sigma..ltoreq.d<.mu.+0.5.sigma. 

.mu.+0.5.sigma..ltoreq.d<.mu.+.sigma. 

.mu.+.sigma..ltoreq.d (14) 

The quantized feature value, f, can then be uniquely computed from this conglomerate of the quantized projection coefficient values. For example if there are three quantized projection values, e.sub.1, e.sub.2, and e.sub.3, and if each of them takes on 5 possible values from 0 to 4, then f takes a value from 0 to 124 given by: 

f=e.sub.1+5e.sub.2+5.sup.2e.sub.3 (15) 

[0140] In another method, referred to herein as "vector quantization #1", the projection coefficients can be quantized by a form of vector quantization. The final quantized feature value, f, is computed from a truncated ordering of the coefficients magnitudes. For example, in one embodiment with 5 projection coefficients, the 3 largest coefficients are placed in order of their magnitude. There are 60 (=5!/2!) possible orderings of these 3 largest values. Each of these projection coefficients may be positive or negative. The "f" combines the ordering of the coefficients with their signs (positive or negative) giving a total of 480 (=60*2.sup.3) possible values for "f" 

[0141] A different method, referred to herein as "vector quantization #2, modifies vector quantization #1 by considering up to 3 values whose magnitude exceeds some pre-specified threshold. In one embodiment, this threshold is chosen as twice the mean of the coefficients corresponding to the top 3 projection vectors (in the case of projection vectors derived from principal components analysis) computed from the object training images. In this method, "f" takes on 571 values given by 480 values (if three coefficients exceed the threshold) plus 80 values (if two coefficients exceed the threshold) plus 10 values (if one coefficient value exceeds the threshold) plus 1 value (if no coefficient values exceed the threshold). 

[0142] Another method, referred to herein as "vector quantization #3, is a modification of vector quantization #2. The vector quantization#3 method quantizes the coefficient due to the first principal component separately. In one embodiment, it quantizes this coefficient into 5 levels where the thresholds for these levels are given by: 

d<.mu..times..sigma. 

.mu.-.sigma..ltoreq.d<.mu.-0.5.sigma. 

.mu.-0.5.sigma..ltoreq.d<.mu.+0.5.sigma. 

.mu.+0.5.sigma..ltoreq.d<.mu.+.sigma. 

.mu.+.sigma..ltoreq.d (16) 

This method then applies the vector quantization scheme #2 by ordering the top 3 of the 4 remaining coefficients, resulting in 249 possible values. In this method. "f" overall then has 1245 possible values corresponding to the product of these 249 values with 5 possible values for the quantized first coefficient. 

[0143] Another method, referred to herein as "vector quantization #4, is also a modification of vector quantization #2, This method initially applies vector quantization #2. Then it applies a second threshold to the ordered coefficients. In one embodiment, this second threshold is four times the mean of the coefficients corresponding to the top 3 projection vectors (in the case of projection vectors derived from principal components analysis) computed from the object training images. The vector quantization #4 method then counts the number of coefficients that exceed this second threshold. This number can range from 0 to 3. Therefore, in this method, "f" has four times as many possible values as it does for vector quantization #2. 

[0144] Often it is useful to use an additional measurenent--"energy orthogonal to the projection"--given by the energy orthogonal to projection vectors. This energy equals: 

g = l = 1 N w i 2 - j = 1 Q p j 2 ( 17 ) ##EQU00010## 

Where N is the number of wavelet coefficients in a subset and Q is the number of projection vectors. Each "p.sub.j" is a projection coefficient given by equation-13 and each "w.sub.1" is a wavelet coefficient. In one embodiment, the value of "g" in equation (17) can be quantized to 4 levels. The quantization thresholds may be 0.5 g.sub.ave,g.sub.ave, and 2.0 g.sub.ave, where g.sub.ave is the average value of g computed over the object training image set. Combining this measurement with any other quantized measurement increases the total number of quantization bins by a factor of 4. 

[0145] It may also be useful to use an additional measurement--"energy of the projection"--given by the energy of the projection. This energy equals: 

h = j = 1 Q p j 2 ( 18 ) ##EQU00011## 

Where Q is the number of projection vectors. In one embodiment, the variable "h" in equation. (18) is quantized to 4 levels. The quantization thresholds are 0.5 h.sub.ave, 2.0h.sub.ave, and 4.0h.sub.ave, where h.sub.ave is the average value of h computed over the object training image set. Combining this measurement with any other quantized measurement increases the total number of quantization bins by a factor of 4. 

[0146] Some additional examples of various other quantization methods include the following: 

(1) A "scalar quantization 1-A" method that combines scalar quantization #1 with the energy of the projection vectors measurement. (2) A "vector quantization 1-A" method that combines vector quantization #1 with the energy of the projection vectors measurement. (3) A "vector quantization 2-A" method that combines vector quantization #2 with the energy of the projection vectors measurement. (4) A "vector quantization 3-A" method that combines vector quantization #3 with the energy of the projection vectors measurement. (5) A "vector quantization 4-A" method that combines vector quantization #4 with the energy orthogonal of the projection vectors measurement. (6) A "scalar quantization 1-B" method combines scalar quantization #1 with the energy orthogonal to the projection vectors measurement. (7) A "vector quantization 1-B" method that combines vector quantization #1 with the energy orthogonal to the projection vectors measurement (8) A "vector quantization 2-B" method that combines vector quantization #2 with the energy orthogonal to the projection vectors measurement. (9) A "vector quantization 3-B" method that combines vector quantization #3 with the energy orthogonal to the projection vectors measurement. (10) A "vector quantization 4-B" method that combines vector quantization #4 with the energy orthogonal to the projection vectors measurement. 

[0147] The following discusses an embodiment that uses various combinations of the quantization methods outlined above. In one embodiment, candidate subsets are represented by a form of vector quantization on each entire subset giving a function f.sub.i(S.sub.i). In one embodiment, these functions, f.sub.i(S.sub.i), are learned from the combined object training examples 150 and non-object training examples 154 using tree-structured vector quantization (TSVQ) over the entire set of training examples. A discussion of TSVQ is provided in Allen Gersho and Robert M. Gray, Vector Quantization and Signal Compression, published by Springer (1992), the relevant portion of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. 

[0148] An example tree 220 is shown in FIG. 22, which is adapted from FIG. 9.1 in the Gersho and Gray article mentioned above. Each node, 222A through 222M, in the tree 220 is associated with a "test-vector". Each function f.sub.i(S.sub.i) is computed using such a tree. Starting at the root node C*(222A), the function f.sub.i(S.sub.i) compares the input, S.sub.i=s, to each of the test vectors of node's children (e.g., nodes C0, C1, C2, etc.). It then chooses the child node whose test vector is closest to the input vector and the process repeats using its children. Such a process is continually repeated until anode with no children (e.g., a node in the set of nodes 222E through 222M) is encountered. Such a node is called a "terminal node". Each terminal node has a unique code (i.e., a discrete value) giving the value of the function f.sub.i(S.sub.i) for the input, S.sub.i=s. 

[0149] A method forms each quantization tree by repeatedly splitting the training data (the combination of blocks 154 and 150 in FIG. 17B) into clusters. The algorithm may begin by splitting the entire data into "r" clusters using the k-means algorithm over the variables represented by S.sub.i. A description of the k-means algorithm can be found in R. Duda, P. Hart, D. Stork, "Pattern Classification," second edition, John Wiley & Sons (2001), and a relevant portion of this book describing the k-means algorithm is incorporated herein by reference. Other suitable clustering methods known in the art may be employed in place of the k-means approach. This split forms the first branches in the tree where each of these clusters becomes a node. The means of these "r" clusters become the "test vectors" for these nodes. The algorithm then recursively splits each resulting cluster until reaching a desired tree depth or some other suitable termination condition. The terminal nodes each may have a unique code. However, the actual codes used may not be important, so long as each terminal node has a unique code Typically, the codes are integer values from 1 to "n", which are arbitrarily assigned to "n" terminal nodes. 

[0150] The TSVQ approach may provide savings over ordinary VQ (vector quantization) in the number of comparisons that need to be performed. In ordinary VQ, the amount of computation is O(n) or "order of n"--the input has to be compared with all the nodes. Whereas, in a tree-structured VQ (TSVQ), the number of comparisons is a function of the depth of the tree and the branching factor, and leads to a computation cost that are O(log(n)) (order of log(n)) for a balanced tree. 

[0151] As mentioned earlier, any probability distribution can be represented by many functional forms (e.g., neural network, mixture of Gaussians, kernel-density function, etc.). In one embodiment, described in more detail hereinbelow, the functional form of each probability distribution in equation (7) (restricted Bayesian Network) is represented by a table of values where each entry in the table is indexed by a different value of "f", the quantized feature value described hereinabove. For example, consider a hypothetical probability distribution P(f.sub.4) where f.sub.4 takes on 5 possible values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Such a table would have five entries corresponding to each of these possible values. Each entry would be a probability and all 5 probabilities would sum to 1.0. Under this representation, the restricted Bayesian network takes the following form: 

P ( X 1 , , X n ) = P ( f 1 ) P ( f 2 ) P ( f n ) [ P ( X 1 ) ] x 1 [ P ( X 2 ) ] x 2 [ P ( X n ) ] x n ( 19 ) ##EQU00012## 

[0152] In one embodiment, the estimate_candidate_feature_probability_object module 195 and the estimate_candidate_feature_probability_non_object module 194 in FIG. 21 estimate probability tables from the training data. Both of these modules constitute the estimate probability distribution module 159 in FIG. 17B. As illustrated in FIG. 23, this training process may include, gathering histograms over object and non-object training images (blocks 200 and 204, respectively), normalizing the histograms to compute P(f.sub.n|.omega..sub.1) (object) and P(f.sub.n|.omega..sub.2) (non-object) for each subset (blocks 202 and 206, respectively), and forming the log-likelihood ratio: log [P(f.sub.n|.omega..sub.1)/P(f.sub.n|.omega..sub.2)](block 208). Histogram collection and normalization is discussed below with reference to discussion of FIGS. 24 and 25. 

[0153] The estimate_candidate_feature_probability_object module 195 and the estimate_candidate_feature_probability_non_object module 194 in FIG. 21 may also estimate marginal probability distributions, P(X.sub.1|.omega..sub.1) and P(X.sub.1|.omega..sub.1) for each input variable X.sub.1 . . . X.sub.n. These distributions may be used to represent the denominator of equation (7). Each of these distributions is estimated as a histogram where each variable is quantized to a pre-determined set of levels. A method of histogram construction is discussed later hereinbelow. Each variable may be quantized to a pre-determined set of levels. In one embodiment, each variable is quantized to 13 levels given by: 

d<.mu.-3.sigma. 

.mu.-3.sigma..ltoreq.d<.mu.-1.9.sigma. 

.mu.-1.9.sigma..ltoreq.d<.mu.-1.2.sigma. 

.mu.-1.2.sigma..ltoreq.d<.mu.-0.7.sigma. 

.mu.-0.7.sigma..ltoreq.d<.mu.-0.35.sigma. 

.mu.-0.35.sigma..ltoreq.d<.mu.-0.1 .sigma. 

.mu.-0.1.sigma..ltoreq.d<.mu.+0.1.sigma. 

.mu.+0.1.sigma..ltoreq.d<.mu.+0.35.sigma. 

.mu.+0.35.sigma..ltoreq.d<.mu.+0.7.sigma. 

.mu.+0.7.sigma..ltoreq.d<.mu.+1.2.sigma. 

.mu.+1.2.sigma..ltoreq.d<.mu.+1.9.sigma. 

.mu.+1.9.sigma..ltoreq.d<.mu.+3.sigma. 

.mu.+3.sigma..ltoreq.d (20) 

[0154] FIG. 24 illustrates an exemplary histogram 58. The histogram 58 shown in FIG. 24 is for illustrative purposes only. In actual operation, the set of histograms for the classifier 34 may contain many more histograms with many different values. A histogram counts the frequency of occurrence of values of a given function. Each column in a histogram is called a "bin." The bin is a count of the number of times a specific value of the given function has occurred. Thus, for example, the bin for y=1 or 4 in FIG. 24 shows that the value y=1 or 4 has occurred 20 (twenty) times, whereas the value of y=6 has occurred 15 (fifteen) times, and so on. 

[0155] In one embodiment, the statistics for the object training images may be gathered in steps 200 and 204 in FIG. 23. As shown in FIG. 25, a discrete value, f, (the quantized feature value) is computed for each training image. In the example of FIG. 25, the quantizier for subset-1, f.sub.1, takes the value "567", whereas the quantizer for subset-k, f.sub.k, takes the value "350". The term "subsets" as used herein refers to the candidate subsets of coefficients generated by block 144 in FIG. 17B or equivalently block 192 in FIG. 20. It is noted that because of quantization there may be more than one combination of input values producing the same discrete value. 

[0156] Histograms can be collected by counting the number of occurrences of each quantized value across the set of training images. Then, a table of probabilities (not shown) can be generated for each probability distribution P(f.sub.k|.omega..sub.1) (object) and P(f.sub.k|.omega..sub.2) (non-object) from the corresponding histograms, H.sub.k,object( ) and H.sub.k,object( ), associated with feature f.sub.k as shown in FIG. 25. Each probability value in the table (not shown) corresponds to a bin in the respective histogram (not shown). For example, for feature `f.sub.1`, to compute the probability of feature value "567." the bin count H.sub.1(#567) is divided by the count of all bins for histogram H.sub.1 (i.e., .SIGMA. H.sub.1(#i)). Other probabilities may be similarly calculated. This process represents the normalization steps in blocks 202 and 206 in FIG. 23. It is noted that although FIG. 25 shows human faces constituting the set of training images 118, the method outlined in FIG. 25 can also be used to collect histograms corresponding to a sub-classifier for training images of any object including, for example, cars, telephones, shopping cans, etc., and also for the "non-object" class. 

[0157] The evaluate_training_examples_object module 196 and the evaluate_training_examples_non_object module 197 in FIG. 21 evaluate the probability of each labeled example with respect to all subset probability distributions, P(F.sub.1|.omega..sub.1), . . . , P(F.sub.q|.omega..sub.1) and P(F.sub.q|.omega..sub.1), . . . ,P(F.sub.q|.omega..sub.2), and all probability distributions over the input variables, P(X.sub.1|.omega..sub.1), . . . ,P(X.sub.n|.omega..sub.1) and P(X.sub.1|.omega..sub.2), . . . ,P(X.sub.n|.omega..sub.2). The evaluation may be done by table look-up; that is, for evaluating a given training example, X, against a particular distribution, P(F.sub.k|.omega..sub.1), the example's feature value f=F.sup.k(X) is first computed, by the methods described hereinbefore, and then the probability associated with this value is retrieved by using the value as index into the table representing P(f=F.sub.k|.omega..sub.1). The modules 196 and 197 constitute the module 160 in FIG. 17B. The select_best_subset combination module 198 in FIG. 21 chooses a classifier in the form of equation (19) by using r of the q candidate subsets. This module 198 form the module 161 in FIG. 17B. A goal of classifier selection is to make the choice that minimizes empirical classification error over a set of labeled examples. In particular, it may be desirable to select the classifier structure that leads to the largest area underneath the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. This measure accounts for the classifier's full operating range over values for the threshold, .lamda., in equation (1). It is noted that a description of the ROC curve can be found in R. Duda, P. Hart, D. Stork, "Pattern Classification," second edition, John Wiley & Sons (2001), and a relevant portion of this book describing the ROC curve is incorporated herein by reference. 

[0158] In one embodiment, a restricted Bayesian Network in the form of equation (19) is formed for a given combination of candidate subsets through the following process. It is noted that disjoint subsets are treated as statistically independent. For example, the network formed by two disjoint subsets, S.sub.1 and S.sub.2, becomes two disjoint nodes representing P(S.sub.1) and P(S.sub.2), respectively, with overall probability P(S.sub.1)P(S.sub.2). On the other hand, two intersecting subsets are treated as conditionally independent on the common variables. For example, a Bayesian network composed from S.sub.3 and S.sub.4 with 

R = S 3 S 4 = { X 17 , X 33 , X 92 } ( 21 ) ##EQU00013## 

has a structure with a third node representing P(R). This node is then parent to two nodes with probabilities P(S.sub.3|R) and P(S.sub.4|R). The overall probability for this network is then; 

P(S.sub.3,S.sub.4)=P(S.sub.1|R)P(S.sub.4|R)P(R) (22) 

Under feature representation for each subset, the relationship in equation (22) becomes: 

P ( S 3 , S 4 ) .apprxeq. P ( F 3 | R ) P ( F 4 | R ) P ( R ) = P ( F 3 ) P ( F 4 ) P ( R ) ( 23 ) ##EQU00014## 

where F.sub.3=f(S.sub.3) and F.sub.4=f(S.sub.4) 

[0159] To efficiently compute classification error, it may be preferable to make an independence assumption in representing the parent node, P(R). Doing so, the overall probability may be written in the form of equation: 

P ( S 3 , S 4 ) .apprxeq. P ( F 3 ) P ( F 4 ) [ P ( X 17 ) ] a 17 [ P ( X 33 ) ] a 35 [ P ( X 92 ) ] a 92 ( 24 ) ##EQU00015## 

where the members of the parent, R, are represented as statistically independent. In this reduced parameterization, there are pre-computed distributions for every term, whereas, in the form of equation (23), one may have to estimate P(R) in the very least; that is, one cannot obtain P(R) by marginalizing P(F.sub.3) or P(F.sub.4) since they involve dimensionality reduction on the original variables. It also may not be possible to originally estimate the full distributions. P(S.sub.3) and P(S.sub.4), because S.sub.3 and S.sub.4 are usually of too high dimension. It is noted that the .alpha.'s may be computed from the number of occurrences of the variable, e.sub.i(see, e.g., equation-15), over all the chosen subsets. It is noted that e.sub.i greater than "1" indicates some redundancy in representing the variable across these subsets. Therefore, it may be preferable to choose the term in the denominator in equation (24) to correct for this redundancy and choose .alpha..sub.3=e.sub.i-1. Otherwise, the contribution of the variable would be "over-counted." 

[0160] In the general case, the probability distribution formed over many subsets is: 

P ( X 1 , , X n ) = P ( F j ( i ) ) P ( F j ( 2 ) ) P ( F j ( r ) ) [ P ( X 1 ) ] a 1 [ P ( X 2 ) ] a 2 [ P ( X n ) ] a n ( 25 ) ##EQU00016## [0161] where j(1) . . . j(r).epsilon.{1, . . . ,q} The numerator in equation (25) gives the product of all r chosen subsets and the denominator could be thought of as correction for redundancy among these subsets. Using the parameterization discussed hereinabove, the overall log-likelihood function may be given as: 

[0161] f ( X ) = P ( F j ( 1 ) | .omega. 1 ) P ( F j ( 2 ) | .omega. 1 ) P ( F j ( r ) | .omega. 1 ) [ P ( X 1 | .omega. 1 ) ] a 1 [ P ( X 2 | .omega. 1 ) ] a 2 [ P ( X n | .omega. 1 ) ] a n P ( F j ( 1 ) | .omega. 2 ) P ( F j ( 2 ) | .omega. 2 ) P ( F j ( r ) | .omega. 2 ) [ P ( X 1 | .omega. 2 ) ] a 1 [ P ( X 2 | .omega. 2 ) ] a 2 [ P ( X n | .omega. 2 ) ] a n ( 26 ) ##EQU00017## 

[0162] For a given chosen candidate subset combination and a given training example, an appropriate set of pre-computed values of P(f.sub.k|.omega..sub.1),P(f.sub.k|.omega..sub.2), P(X.sub.i|.omega..sub.1), and P(X.sub.1|.omega..sub.2) for that training example are retrieved by table look-up. These values may then be substituted in equation (26) to get the log-likelihood ratio for a given labeled example. 

[0163] The select_best_candidate_feature_combination or select_best_subset_combinations module 198 in FIG. 21 greedily searches for structure of equation (26) by incrementally combining subsets such that ROC area characteristic is maximized over all training examples. In one embodiment, this greedy search involves the process 230 illustrated in FIG. 26. After evaluating all candidate subsets on the training data (step 232), the first candidate subset (K=1) is chosen at step 234. The area under the ROC curve is calculated for each of the Q sets of sub-classifiers selected in step 236 in FIG. 26. The best M candidate sets of "K" sub-classifiers can then be chosen in step 238, where these are the M candidates that give the largest area under the ROC curve. In step 240, the value of K can be incremented by one. Then, at step 242, candidate combinations of size K can be created by adding another sub-classifier to each of the M candidates of size K-1. The selection of best M combinations with "K" members is again performed at block 241. The process 230 of FIG. 26 can begin again at step 236 for sets of sub-classifiers of size K The process can be completed when K reaches a predetermined value (e.g., K=20). In one embodiment, the ROC curve of these final M candidate sub-classifiers can be evaluated in step 244 on the cross-validation data (block 152 in FIGS. 17A-17B). The best set of K sub-classifiers can then be chosen according to this criterion. 

[0164] It is observed that an ROC curve is a plot of the number of objects classified correctly versus number of false positives for a given classifier evaluated on a given set of test images. Each point on the plot (not shown) may represent evaluation for a different value of (in equation (1)). The area under the ROC curve is related to the performance of the classifier. Thus, a greater area indicates better performance of the algorithm. Hence, for example, in face detection, a high area means that a high number of faces classified correctly can be achieved with a low number of false positives. 

[0165] The search illustrated in the process 230 of FIG. 26 may be performed multiple times, (e.g., 10 times in one embodiment) to select multiple structures by restricting successive searches from making identical choices to previous searches. The module 198 in FIG. 21 compares the structures determined (using, for example, the process 230 of FIG. 26) by making more costly performance comparisons on cross-validation data (images that are separate from other aspects of training). The module 198 then chooses the structure that performs best on these cross-validation images based on the ROC criterion. 

[0166] The construct_Bayes_Network module or the construction_full_Bayesian_Network block 148 in FIG. 17A may be configured to derive a final representation for the probability distribution that does not involve making the independence assumption in equation (26) (the independence of a node's parents). The module 148 forms a full Bayesian network given by equation (6) from the independencies and dependencies implied by the subset grouping where if any two subsets contain overlapping variables, the two subsets are represented as conditionally independent given the overlapping variables. The Bayesian Network Connectivity module 162 (which is part of the module 148 in FIG. 17A) in FIG. 17B may derive the graphical structure of the Bayesian network through the following process. The module 162 may identify all groups of variables that act in unison; that is, a group of variables that always co-occur together when they occur in a subset. Each such set of variables will form a node in the final network. For example, consider subsets (X1,X7), (X1,X2,X3), (X1,X2,X4,X5), (X4,X5,X6). In these subsets, only the combination (X4,X5) acts in unison. Hence, the combination (X1,X2) would not form a node because only one of them (X1) occurs in the first group (X1,X7)--i.e., X1 does not always occur in unison with X2 as seen from the first group (X1,X7). Some variables may not act in unison with any other variables. Each such variable may become a separate node. Thus, this example produces the following nodes: N.sub.1=(X1), N.sub.2=(X2), N.sub.3=(X3), N.sub.4=(X4,X5), N.sub.5=(X6), N.sub.6=(X7). The module 162 may then form the network by placing the nodes in some ordering. The ordering may be determined by a process described hereinbelow. 

[0167] The module 162 may add directed arcs to indicate parent-child relationships within the ordering. A node becomes a parent to another node if it precedes the second node in the ordering and if both nodes occur in a subset; that is, if the variables from these two nodes occur together within at least one subset. There are n! possible orderings of the n subsets each leading to a different network topology. Each of these orderings can produce a network satisfying the dependencies implied by the subsets. However, some of these networks will be more desirable than others in that they minimize the dimensionality of the resulting conditional probability distributions. For example, consider 3 subsets: (X1,X2), (X1,X3), (X1,X4) producing nodes (X1)(X2)(X3)(X4). If(X1) is placed as the last node in the ordering, then the network contains a four dimensional conditional probability distribution: P(X1|X2, X3, X4). On the other hand, if (X1) is the first node, the maximum dimensionality of any conditional probability distribution will be 2. To minimize the dimensionality of a conditional probability distribution at anode, it may be desirable to minimize the number of incoming branches to the node. 

[0168] The "branch count", i.e., the total number of branches flowing in and out of a node, is pre-determined regardless of the topology. The branches associated with a particular node are determined by which other nodes belong to the same subsets--i.e., the ordering process may take every subset that the node belongs to, and may also take form the total set of other nodes that belong to any of the same subsets. The node must be connected to each of these other nodes by a branch. The ordering of the nodes, however, determines the direction of these connections. 

[0169] In choosing an ordering, it is desirable to find a network in which the conditional probability distributions are as small as possible. The best possible case is a network with "n" terminal nodes (where "n" is the number of subsets and no subset is proper subset of another subset), where the dimension of any conditional probability distribution along the path to each terminal node is less than or equal to the dimension of the subsets represented by the product of conditional probability distributions along this path. However, depending on the composition of subsets, such as arrangement may not be always possible. In one embodiment, the ordering of nodes in the network may be assigned by the following process. First, the node with the maximum branch count may be identified and assigned as the first node. Other nodes may then be added, one by one, in order of branch count, but considering only those nodes which would become children of nodes already in the network. If a point is reached where none of the unassigned nodes has a parent among the network nodes, then another node with the largest branch count may be added and the process may continue adding nodes in the same fashion. 

[0170] In order to represent the chosen Bayesian network, it may be desirable to represent the conditional probability distributions at all nodes, P(N.sub.1|Pa.sub.n1, .omega..sub.1), . . . , P(N.sub.q|Pa.sub.nq.omega..sub.1) and P(N.sub.1|Pa.sub.N1,.omega..sub.2), . . . , P(N.sub.q|Pa.sub.Nq,.omega..sub.2), where Pa.sub.Nk is the set of variables of all the parent nodes of node Nk. It may not be possible represent these distributions as full joint probability distributions since their dimensionality will be too great (q of these distributions will at least match the dimensionality of the original subsets). In one embodiment, each conditional probability distribution is represented by a table (not shown) over discrete valued variables as noted hereinbefore. 

[0171] There are several approaches to dimensionality reduction in the context of representing a conditional probability distribution. The following discusses two possibilities. In the first approach, the ratio P(X.sub.1.times.X.sub.2)/P(X.sub.2) [where X.sub.1=N.sub.k (the variables at node K) and X.sub.2=Pa.sub.k (the parent variables at node K)] is represented by quantizing the numerator and the denominator separately; that is, monolithic quantization of the space X.sub.1.times.X.sub.2 may be used and then a separate independent quantization of X2 may be performed as given below: 

Z.sub.1,2=f.sub.1(X.sub.1.times.X.sub.2) (27) 

Z.sub.2=f.sub.2(X.sub.2) (28) 

Alternatively, in the second approach, X.sub.1 and X.sub.2 are quantized separately as given below: 

Z.sub.1=f.sub.1(X.sub.1) (29) 

Z.sub.2=f.sub.2(X.sub.2) (30) 

In the above equations 27-30, "fi( )" denotes the quantized feature value function. 

[0172] The first approach (equations (27) and (28)) may be more attractive in that it is a direct quantization of the space Z.sub.1,2=f.sub.1(X.sub.1.times.X.sub.2) and therefore may be a more efficient representation than that given by the Cartesian product Z.sub.1.times.Z.sub.2 in that it can capture joint relationships between these two sets of variables. However, when this representation (in equations (27) and (28)) is re-written in terms of these quantized variables, it may no longer necessarily be a conditional probability distribution: P(Z.sub.1,2)/P(Z.sub.2), and one can end up representing something different than one intended. In particular, one can imagine pathological cases such as when the dynamic range of X.sub.2 is far larger than that of X.sub.1. In such a case, the quantization of the combined space, Z.sub.1,2, will represent changes in X.sub.2 and neglect changes in X.sub.1. The numerator P(Z.sub.1,2) will then be nearly equivalent to P(Z.sub.2) and the overall expression for their ratio will be nearly equal to one ("1") regardless of the input. In contrast, the 2.sup.nd representation in equations (29) and (30) may maintain the desired conditional relationship. 

[0173] One embodiment (module 163 in FIG. 173) combines aspects of both approaches described hereinabove in conjunction with equations (27) through (30). This approach in module 163 quantizes the variables in the numerator and denominator in the ratio P(X.sub.1.times.X.sub.2)/P(X.sub.2) sequentially using Tree-Structured Vector Quantization (TSVQ) (described hereinbefore) through the following process. The first step forms the quantization tree for X.sub.2 using TSVQ over the entire set of training examples but only with the values of the X.sub.2 variables within each example. This step gives Z.sub.2=f.sub.2(X.sub.2). However, rather than starting from scratch to determine Z.sub.1,2=f.sub.1(X.sub.1.times.X.sub.2), the second step expands the tree representing Z.sub.2=f.sub.2(X.sub.2) further by subdividing and clustering each of its (tree's) terminal nodes using only the X.sub.1 values of each example. This method may give a "hybrid tree" representation for Z.sub.1,2=f.sub.1(X.sub.1.times.X.sub.2), where up to a certain depth, the path through the tree is based on X.sub.2 and then for the remainder of the tree, the path is based on X.sub.1. By doing so, a representation of Z.sub.1,2=f.sub.1(X.sub.1.times.X.sub.2) is obtained that is more efficient and concise than performing the quantization separately for X.sub.1 and X.sub.2 and taking the Cartesian product of their quantized values, Z.sub.1.times.Z.sub.2. For each possible value of X.sub.2, the second step forms a sub-tree that reflects quantized values of X.sub.1 that occur given this value of X.sub.2. Such a quantization method therefore can capture dependencies between X.sub.1 and X.sub.2. Moreover, because the quantization functions in the numerator and denominator are consistent in their representation of X.sub.2, such a representation may preserve the conditional probability relationship. 

[0174] In the embodiment of FIG. 17B, the block 164 computes the conditional probability distributions, P(N.sub.1|Pa.sub.N1,.omega..sub.1), . . . , P(N.sub.q|Pa.sub.Nq, .omega..sub.1) and P(N.sub.1|Pa.sub.N1,.omega..sub.2), . . . , P(N.sub.q|Pa.sub.Nq,.omega..sub.2), of the Bayesian network sub-classifier by a method called AdaBoost with Confidence Weighted Predictions algorithm discussed in R. E. Shapire, Y. Singer, "Improving Boosting Algorithms Using Confidence-rated Predictions", Machine Learning, 37:3, pp. 297-336, December, 1999 (hereafter, "Shapire & Singer"), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Here, Pa.sub.Nk is the set of variables of all the parent nodes of node k. 

[0175] The AdaBoost algorithm is a general method for training pattern classifiers. The AdaBoost algorithm minimizes the classification error on the training set and maximizes the margin between the two classes on the training set as discussed in Shapire & Singer. It is noted here that AdaBoost is a general method that can be applied to any type of classification algorithm. Given any classifier, AdaBoost works by sequentially re-training multiple instances of the classifier, where, for example, each instance corresponds to a different set of values for the look-up tables (not shown) comprising the terms in equation (6): P(N.sub.1|Pa.sub.N1,.omega..sub.1), . . . , P(N.sub.q|Pa.sub.Nq,.omega..sub.1) and P(N.sub.1|Pa.sub.N1,.omega..sub.2), . . . , P(N.sub.q|Pa.sub.Nq,.omega..sub.2). To perform classification, AdaBoost applies all of such instances of the classifier in combination and computes the weighted sum of their output to make a classification decision. This approach may result in the increased computational cost of applying all the classifiers in the combination. The method described hereinbelow is a process for overcoming this increased computational cost of the AdaBoost approach whereby the combination of classifiers is reduced back into one classifier. 

[0176] As shown in FIG. 27, the AdaBoost algorithm works in an iterative fashion. First, a classifier is trained at block 98 in FIG. 27 by assigning the same weight to all training examples (e.g., blocks 150 and 154 in FIGS. 17A-17) at the instance i=1 for that classifier. It is observed here that the training for i=1 may be identical to that discussed hereinbefore in conjunction with block 144 in FIGS. 17A-17B, except that the probability distributions forming the classifier in block 144 in FIGS. 17A-17B are unconditional probability distributions, whereas in the block 98 in FIG. 27 they are conditional probability distributions. For each i>1, the (i-1).sup.th instance is evaluated on the training data (block 96, FIG. 27). Then, the classifier is iteratively retrained where more weight is given to training examples that were incorrectly classified by the classifier trained in the previous iteration (block 98, FIG. 27). This process repeats for p iterations, where "p" represents a predetermined number of iterations. Each iteration produces another instances of the classifier. Currently, there are no rigorous theoretical guidelines on how to choose the value of "p." However, experimentally, a value of as little as "5" can lead to improvement and values as large as "100" can lead to further improvement. In one embodiment, the values for "p" are in the range of 15 to 20. It is shown in Shapire & Singer that through this iteration process the classification error can be decreased. 

[0177] As illustrated in FIG. 27, to re-train an instance of the classifier at each iteration, the AdaBoost algorithm re-computes the histograms for each conditional probability distribution over the object and non-object training samples (block 100) using the weights determined at block 98. Histograms can be collected by counting the number of occurrences of each quantized feature value, f.sub.i(S.sub.i), across the set of training images. However, instead of incrementing each histogram bin by "1" for each training example, it may be preferable to increment by the weight assigned to the training example. For that purpose, it may be desirable to scale and round the training example weights to integers. 

[0178] Block 102 in FIG. 27 computes a log-likelihood look-up table (not shown) for each pair of conditional probability distributions P(N.sub.k|Pa.sub.Nk,.omega..sub.1) and P(N.sub.k|Pa.sub.Nk,.omega..sub.2) (object and non-object classes, respectively) corresponding to a particular node in the Bayesian network. The overall Bayesian network is then given by equation (6), which when used for both classes (object and non-objet) gives the overall sub-classifier given by equation (2). In the following discussion, let G(X)=h.sub.i(X) from equation (2). 

[0179] Normally, under AdaBoost, to perform classification, for each input X, one may have to compute the output generated by X for all instances of the classifier G(X) (i.e., G.sub.i(X), for i=1 . . . p), and then compute the weighted sum of these values, where the weights are given by a.sub.1: 

I = 1 p a i G i ( X ) ( 31 ) where G i ( X ) = j = 1 p log P j ( N j | Pa j , .omega. 1 ) P j ( N j | Pa j , .omega. 2 ) ( 32 ) ##EQU00018## 

This involves "p" times the amount of computation of just evaluating a single instance of the classifier, where a single instance of the classifier could be trained using uniform weighting for all training examples. 

[0180] However, in one embodiment, each G.sub.i(X) is represented by equation (2). By substituting for equation (6) in equation (2), the right-hand side of the classifier in equation (31) can be 

i = 1 p j = 1 n a i log P ij ( N j | P a j , .omega. 1 ) P ij ( N j | P a j , .omega. 2 ) ( 33 ) ##EQU00019## 

The equation (33) can be re-written in a mathematically equivalent form as: 

j = 1 n g j ( X ) ( 34 ) ##EQU00020## 

where each g.sub.i(X) represents a single log-likelihood table pre-computed by the sum: 

g j ( X ) = i = 1 p a i log P ij ( N j | P a j , .omega. 1 ) P ij ( N j | P a j , .omega. 2 ) ( 35 ) ##EQU00021## 

The resulting classifier in equation (34) has the same computational cost as the original classifiers in equation (32) or equivalently, equation (2). 

[0181] In one embodiment p AdaBoost iterations are computed. For each iteration number, 1 . . . p, the determine_detection_threshold module 165 in FIG. 17B measures performance of the classifier on the cross-validation test set (block 152 in FIG. 17B). The number of iterations (say "k") that gives the best performance is chosen and the sum in equation (35) is pre-computed up to k rather than p. 

[0182] In one embodiment, each stage may be "weighted" differently. In particular, equation (4) can be modified such that weights, e.sub.i, can be specified for each stage as given below: 

H=c.sub.1H.sub.1+ . . . +c.sub.NH.sub.N (36) 

or equivalently as a cascade of weights: 

H=H.sub.N+C.sub.N-1(H.sub.N-1+C.sub.N-2(H.sub.N-2. . . +c.sub.1H.sub.1) . . . ) (37) 

In one embodiment, at block 165 in FIG. 17B, the weight C.sub.k-1 may be chosen in the equation (37) by empirically trying a range of values, e.g., (0.1, 0.25, 1.0, 4.0, 10.0), over the set of cross-validation images and choosing the weight that gives the best accuracy as measured with respect to area under the ROC curve. 

[0183] In one embodiment, the performance over these p AdaBoost iterations is computed where, for each iteration, performance is evaluated over several different weightings of the current stage with respect to the previous stages. In one embodiment, these weightings are (0.625, 0.25, 0.6, 1.5, 4.0). The trial that gives the best performance is chosen. The chosen trial indicates the AdaBoost iteration p, and the weighting .alpha.. The sum in equation (34) is computed up top, and then the sum is weighted by .alpha.. 

[0184] In one embodiment, block 165 in FIG. 17B determines the threshold .lamda..sub.k applied to equation (4) to achieve a desired performance by measuring accuracy of classifier up to stage "k" for different settings of .lamda..sub.k on the cross-validation images at block 152 in FIG. 17B. 

Lighting Correction 

[0185] Lighting correction may be necessary to compensate for differences in lighting of various objects (especially when a classifier is to be used for object detection in real life conditions where object lighting may be less then optimal). In one embodiment, a lighting correction process 36 precedes evaluation of the classifier as illustrated in FIG. 4B and by block 70 in FIG. 9. Similarly, in training, lighting correction may be performed on each training example immediately after evaluation of the wavelet transform. Here, the term "evaluation" means "computing the wavelet transform." Such lighting correction is indicated at block 109 in FIG. 18. 

[0186] Unfortunately, no lighting correction method may be dependable in all situations. Therefore, in one embodiment, the classifier 34 applies multiple methods of compensation, where each method provides its input to a different group of sub-classifiers. Such an approach may be less susceptible to the failures of an individual method of correction. 

[0187] In one embodiment, a "localized lighting correction" method adjusts the value of each wavelet coefficient as a function of its neighboring coefficients from within its subband and from other subbands. Each coefficient in each band may be normalized as follows. Each LL coefficient is normalized by its 3.times.3 (pixels) neighborhood in the LL band. The normalization process computes the average absolute value of the neighborhood. If this average is less than a pre-specified threshold (described hereinbelow), the coefficient is assigned a value of "1.0". Otherwise, the normalized LL coefficient is computed as the ratio of the original coefficient divided by this neighborhood average. Each coefficient in the LH and HL bands is normalized by the combined average of its 3.times.3 neighborhoods in the LH and HL bands. If this average is less than a threshold, the normalization process assigns value "0.0" to the normalized coefficient. If the average is greater than the threshold, the normalized coefficient is given by the ratio of the original coefficient divided by this average. Each coefficient in the HH band is normalized by the average of its 3.times.3 neighborhood in the HH band. If this average is less than a threshold, the normalization process assigns value "0.0" to the normalized coefficient. If the average is greater than the threshold, the normalization process divides the original coefficient by the average to give the normalized coefficient. In one embodiment, these thresholds are "1.0" for all LL bands, "2.5" for LH and HL subbands, and "1.25" for HH subbands. These thresholds may be selected empirically. 

[0188] In another embodiment, a "variance normalization" method linearly scales all the wavelet coefficients in the image window or some selected portion of it (described hereinbelow), such that the intensities in the region or a selected portion of it, have a pre-specified variance value. Alternatively, or in addition to the lighting corrections methods mentioned hereinbefore, a "brightest point normalization" method may be used to scale all wavelet coefficients such that the brightest spot in the candidate region or some selected portion of it (described hereinbelow) has a fixed value. 

Evaluation of Classifier 

[0189] FIG. 28 illustrates an exemplary process 248 that explains blocks 70, 72, 74, and 76 from FIG. 9 in more detail evaluating a single feature from a sub-classifier at the specified candidate locations. This process is repeated for all features comprising the sub-classifier as seen from the process loop at block 266 in FIG. 28. At block 250, the image window 32 is placed at a first location in the set of image window locations to be evaluated. At block 252, the wavelet coefficients used by the feature f.sub.k are sampled. It is observed here that, at block 252, the wavelet coefficient are chosen from the corresponding image window 32 within the selected components of the wavelet transform of the image (i.e., the input image 16 or a scaled version of the input image). At block 254 in the process 248, lighting correction is applied to the wavelet coefficients, where the lighting correction was computed at block 70 of FIG. 9. Blocks 256, 258 and 260 in FIG. 28 involve computing feature value f.sub.k (for example, by TSVQ or projecting the wavelet coefficients on the linear projection vectors and computing a quantized feature value from projection coefficients), and retrieving the log-likelihood associated with the quantized value. The operations at blocks 256, 258, and 260 may be identical to their counterparts in the classifier training procedure described hereinbefore. At block 262, the log-likelihood for the candidate within this phase and stage is updated by adding the retrieved log-likelihood value to the corresponding log-likelihood sum for the candidate. The image window 32 can then be shifted to a second location (as shown, for example, in FIG. 13B) and the log-likelihood ratio for the sub-classifier at the second location can be found by the calculation of blocks 252, 254, 256, 258, 260, and 262. This process can be repeated for a third and a fourth location and so on until the sub-classifier has been evaluated at all specified locations as indicated at blocks 264 and 266. 

[0190] A classifier (e.g., the classifier 34 in FIGS. 4A-4B) designed according to the present disclosure may compute "variance normalization" and "brightest point normalization" over various pre-specified extents of the object. The extent of some object does not necessarily occupy the full extent of the classification window 32. For example, the face training examples shown in FIG. 25 do not occupy the complete area of the window 32. In one embodiment, the average extent of the object may be entered by hand and used for normalization. This extent may be split into two horizontal halves that are normalized separately. 

[0191] FIGS. 20-21 illustrate a conceivable orderings of computation. The actual organization of the aforementioned computations may depend on the particular classifier stage. In particular, each stage can be evaluated in a "candidate-wise" manner (FIG. 29) or a "feature-wise" manner (FIG. 30). The "candidate-wise" evaluation performs all feature evaluations separately for each candidate window. This approach involves a total of N.sup.2.times.M.sup.2 feature evaluations for M.sup.2 sub-classifiers and N.sup.2 candidates as shown in FIG. 29. On the other hand, the "feature-wise" evaluation of FIG. 30 attempts to reduce computation cost by sharing feature evaluations among overlapping candidates. This strategy performs approximately N.sup.2+M.sup.2+2MN feature evaluations over the entire scaled image (assuming all candidates are to be evaluated). Each candidate then samples the M.sup.z evaluations that overlap its extent and supplies them to the corresponding M.sup.2 sub-classifier log-likelihood look-up tables as illustrated in FIG. 30. Typically, since N is much greater than M, this strategy greatly reduces the amount of computation. The M.sup.2 sub-classifiers, however, can differ only in their log-likelihood tables (as a function of position within the candidate), but must all share the same type of feature computation. Whereas, in the candidate-wise evaluation, the M.sup.2 sub-classifiers can be completely different. 

[0192] If features are computed in a "feature-wise" manner, then the lighting correction must also preferably be applied in the feature-wise manner. The "feature-wise" correction assigns the correction at each wavelet coefficient as a function of a localized neighborhood about that point as described by "localized lighting correction" method hereinabove; that is, the correction is independent of the spatial location of the coefficient within the candidate image window 32. Alternatively, the candidate-wise correction considers the whole candidate or a specified portion and can be accomplished by "variance normalization" or "brightest point normalization" methods described hereinabove. 

[0193] According to one embodiment, the early stages in a classifier may use the "feature-wise" evaluation for both fighting correction and feature evaluation. And, the later stages, in which the remaining candidates are sparser, may use the "candidate-wise" evaluation. One embodiment using four stages uses the feature-wise evaluation for the first three stages and the candidate-wise evaluation for the fourth stage. The first two of the four stages use feature-wise lighting correction using the "localized lighting correction" method described hereinabove. The first stage uses 20 sub-classifiers which share the same feature computation. The second stage uses 24 sub-classifiers that share a feature computation and 42 other sub-classifiers that share another feature computation. The third stage uses the candidate-wise evaluation with 19 sub-classifiers, where 5 sub-classifiers share one feature computation, another 5 share a different feature computation, another 5 share a third feature computation, another 3 share a feature computation, and the last one has a unique feature computation. The fourth stage involves 9 sub-classifiers wherein each sub-classifier has a unique feature computation. 

[0194] According to one embodiment of the present disclosure, features are designed in ascending order of complexity. In the early stages in the classifier, features use small subsets of wavelet coefficients, small numbers of linear projections, and simple quantization. These feature evaluations are designed to be as quick as possible because they have to be applied to many candidates. In another embodiment, the first two stages in the classifier use subsets of size 3-8 coefficients and use two linear projections with the "scalar quantization 1-B" scheme described hereinabove. In later stages (in which there are fewer candidates), features use larger subset sizes, more linear projections, and more complicated quantization schemes such as Tree-Structured Vector Quantization (TSVQ). In one embodiment, a third stage can contain sub-classifiers that considers between four and twenty input variables, 5 linear projections, the "vector quantization 2-A" scheme (discussed hereinbefore) for 4 feature computations, and the "vector quantization 3-A" scheme (discussed hereinbefore) for one feature. A fourth and possibly a fifth stage may contain features derived by TSVQ. 

Object Detection 

[0195] FIG. 31 depicts various images (133 through 136) of humans with the object markers 52 placed on the human faces detected by the object detector 18 (FIG. 1) according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. FIG. 32, on the other hand, illustrates various images (137, 138) of teapots with the object markers 52 placed on the teapots detected by the object detector 18 according to another embodiment of the present disclosure. Similarly, FIG. 33 shows results of object detection for stop signs using the object detector 18 according to an embodiment of the present disclosure over three images 140-142 of various stop signs. 

Face Recognition 

[0196] A classifier (e.g., the classifier 34 in FIGS. 4A-4B) designed according to the teachings of the present disclosure can be used for making other kinds of determinations besides object detection. For example, it can be used to determine if two observations (e.g., two images) belong to the same category or class of images. It could also be used for face recognition as shown in FIG. 34, i.e., to determine if two photographs are of the same person. Such a classifier (e.g., the classifier 34) may model two probability distributions: the probability distribution over observations that come from the same category (person)--P(Im.sub.1,Im.sub.2|Same), and the probability distributions over observations that come from different categories (people)--P(Im.sub.1, Im.sub.2|different). If Im.sub.1 (for Image-1 (not shown)) and Im.sub.2 (for Image-2 (not shown)) are concatenated as one vector of variables, then the method described hereinbefore in FIGS. 17A-17B applies to constructing representations for these probability distributions. Alternatively, the probability distributions P(Im.sub.1-Im.sub.2|same) and P(Im.sub.1-Im.sub.2|different), modeling probabilities over the difference between the two images, could be constructed by the method described in FIGS. 17A and 17B. For the example of face recognition, P(Im.sub.1,Im.sub.2|Same) may be trained using image pairs of examples with both members of each pair come from the same face (but each pair could come from a different face). In FIG. 34, image pairs 270a and 270b are examples of such pairs. On the other hand, P(Im.sub.1,Im.sub.2|different) may be trained by pairs of examples where for each pair the members come from different faces. In FIG. 34, image pairs 272a through 272c are examples of such pairs. The training images may be constrained to a specific size and the faces to a specific orientation and size within this image, as indicated at block 104 in FIG. 18. Then, to apply the classifier 34 to perform face recognition for two non-training faces (e.g., in real life images), the two (non-training) face images may have to be scaled, aligned, and cropped to the same specifications as those applied at block 104 in FIG. 30 and then evaluated by retrieving the probabilities associated with this input of faces, computing the ratio of the retrieved probabilities, and comparing the ratio to a threshold in the same fashion as when the classifier is applied to an input window for face detection. 

[0197] The foregoing describes a system and method for detecting presence of a 3D object in a 2D image containing a 2D representation of the 3D object. The object detector according to the present disclosure may improve upon existing techniques for object detection both in accuracy and computational properties. As described herein, a pre-selected number of view-based classifiers may be trained on sample images prior to performing the detection on an unknown image. The object detection program may then operate on the given input image and compute its wavelet transform for the entire input image. The object detection program may then proceed with sampling of the wavelet coefficients at different image window locations on the input image, and apply each classifier involving linear projection of selected subsets of coefficients, quantization of linear projection coefficients and efficient look-up of pre-computed log-likelihood tables to determine object presence. The object detector's coarse-to-fine object detection strategy coupled with exhaustive object search across different positions and scales may result in an efficient and accurate object detection scheme. The object detector may detect a 3D object over a wide range in angular variation (e.g., 180 degrees) through the combination of a small number of classifiers each specialized to a small range within this range of angular variation. Each classifier according to the present disclosure may contain one or more sub-classifiers, wherein each sub-classifier may be based on a ratio of two Bayesian networks. 

[0198] The object detector may be trained to detect many different types of objects (e.g., airplanes, cat faces, telephones, etc.) besides human faces and cars discussed hereinabove. Some of the applications where the object detector may be used include: commercial image databases (e.g., stock photography) for automatically labeling and indexing of images; an Internet-based image searching and indexing service; finding biological structures in various types of biological images (e.g., MRI, X-rays, microscope images, etc.); finding objects of military interest (e.g., mines, tanks, etc.) in satellite, radar, or visible imagery; finding objects of interest to scientists (e.g., craters, volcanoes, etc.) in astronomical images; as a tool for automatic description of the image content of an image database; to achieve accurate color balancing on human faces and remove "red-eye" from human faces in a digital photo development; for automatic adjustment of focus, contrast, and centering on human faces during digital photography; to automatically point, focus, and center cameras on human faces during video conferencing; enabling automatic zooming on human faces and also face recognition as part of a security and surveillance system; making human-computer interaction more realistic, especially in interactive computer games; and to perform face detection in real-time or near real-time, in robotic toys to perform face detection in real-time or near real-time and to have the toy behave accordingly. 

[0199] While the disclosure has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the embodiments. Thus, it is intended that the present disclosure cover the modifications and variations of this disclosure provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.

Methods, Devices and Systems for Algae Lysis and Content Extraction 

Abstract
Described herein are devices, systems and methods for lysing algae cells, for production of a lysate product such as a biofuel. The systems and methods use a passive device that lyses the cells through flow configurations, geometries, and surfaces that would induce different stresses and negative pressure on the microalgae cells. When the stress is designed to exceed the mechanical strength of the microalgae cells, the cells are lysed, causing, e.g., lipid release which can be used to produce biofuels. Through an internally-created computational framework, the concept is validated and can be optimized for the lowest energy input with the highest level of lipid release. Also provided herein are computer-implemented methods for optimizing lysis in such systems and computer-readable media containing instructions for performing the computer-implemented methods.

Description


CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS 

[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/849,712, Filed Feb. 1, 2013, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. 

[0003] In the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the United States government mandated the use of 36 billion gallons of renewable biofuels, annually, by the year 2022. To help meet this quota, biofuels, such as algae-based biodiesel, are gaining much attention because algae can be farmed on non-arable land, do not compete with food production, and have a high growth rate. Algae is a large group of photosynthetic, aquatic organisms that lack the roots, stems, and leaves of higher plants. Algae are extremely biodiverse and have the ability to accumulate lipids. Algae can be classified into two groups: macroalgae which are multicellular, and microalgae which are unicellular. Algae biomass is an attractive source of biofuel due to its high productivity and its ability to thrive in, otherwise, unusable areas. Producing biofuels from algae thus increases utilization of low-quality water sources and terrain without impeding upon nutrient-rich agricultural land. 

[0004] The lipid extraction process is a crucial precursor step in which the oil is removed from the algae cells. Energy consumed during this process reduces the economic feasibility of algae-based biofuel as an alternative to conventional fossil fuels. Mechanical methods are particularly attractive for lipid extraction because they do not require harsh, expensive chemicals nor the production of intense microwaves. However, most devices that have been designed to perform mechanical lipid extraction, such as French press homogenizers, were designed with more consideration for preserving the integrity of the cell contents than for consideration of energy usage at industrial scales. Developing new mechanical technologies to actively lyse (rupture) algae cells in order to extract the lipids can be a costly trial-and-error process. An economical and efficient method to lyse algae cells is therefore very desirable. 

SUMMARY 

[0005] To make microalgal biofuels an efficient energy source, microalgal biofuel processes must be optimized to reduce the energy consumption within the dewatering (separating the liquid and solid algal particulates), cell lysis (cell membrane rupture), and lipid acquisition stages. The systems and methods described herein facilitate lysis of algae for applications such as, but not limited to, biofuel production. The passive/semi-passive process lyses the cells through flow configurations, geometries, and surfaces that induce different stresses and negative pressure on the microalgae cells. When the stress induced through passive/semi-passive flow processes is exceeds the mechanical strength of the microalgae cells, the cells are lysed, causing lipid release. Through an internally-created computational framework, the concept is validated and can be optimized for the lowest energy input with the highest level of lipid release. As shown herein, in one embodiment of this device passive methods can be employed to lyse algae as they flow from a photobioreactor to a downstream lipid extraction processes in order to reduce the amount of energy needed to extract the lipids. 

[0006] This invention invokes fluid dynamics and cell mechanics concepts to lyse cells passively that would decrease the energy consumption of the algal biofuel process. This passive system uses in-flow and surface interactions instead of energy-intensive processes, such as mechanical screw presses, French presses, etc., that are currently employed. These processes minimize use, or remove the requirement of chemicals that can alter the composition and effectiveness of the algae contents as well as increase the cost of the algae biofuel process. This stark difference in approach solves the inefficiencies of biofuel production helping to make it a viable candidate as a renewable energy source. 

[0007] According to one embodiment of the methods described herein, a computational framework is used to predict the energy consumed during mechanical lipid extraction for algae-based biofuel production and/or shear stresses on algae cells. The method models fluid-induced shear stress applied to the cell, in combination with the motion and physical characteristics of individual algae cells, which are simulated by a combination of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and discrete element method (DEM), respectively. The current work is unique in that it presents a low-energy configuration for algae lipid extraction. A computer-generated model is created to simulate the performance of this configuration. 

[0008] By modeling the algae lipid extraction and the fluid flow around the algae cell, this work displays the relationship between algae cell lipid extraction efficiency and energy consumption. Understanding this relationship, and having models to predict it, are important in the development of a viable, low-energy lipid extraction processes for algae-based biofuel production. It was also found that the model can be used to predict the areas in the flow where lipid extraction is most likely to occur. Such information can be used to fabricate the novel lipid extraction device modeled in this work to minimize energy consumption during lipid extraction for algae-based biofuel production. 

[0009] A system is therefore provided for producing an algae lysate from an algae culture in an algae culture medium. The system comprises a reservoir having a fluid outlet adapted for removal of fluid from the reservoir; a fluid conduit attached to the fluid outlet and comprising one or more lysing structures comprising a fluid flow path and a flow-altering structure that modifies the flow path to generate sufficient force to lyse an algae cell in the algae culture in at least a portion of the flow path at a flow rate generated by either a gravitational head of water of 40 meters or less, 60 psi or less or 30 W or less. In use, the system comprises algae in algae culture medium within the reservoir at a level above the fluid outlet of the reservoir. In one embodiment, the flow rate is less than or equal to a gravity flow rate. In another embodiment, the flow rate is produced by a pressure of 60 psi or less. In yet another embodiment, the flow rate is generated by a gravitational head of water of between 8 and 40 meters. In a further embodiment, the fluid flow, and the flow rate is produced by 48,000 or less Joules (J) per Liter of the algae culture in the algae culture medium, and in one embodiment between 8 J and 48,000 J per Liter of the algae culture in the algae culture medium. In one embodiment, the lysing structure lyses at least 5%, 10%, 25%, 50% or 75% of the cells at the flow rate. 

[0010] The system comprises one or more lysing structures and in one embodiment, comprises two or more lysing structures. In one embodiment, the flow-altering structure is a protuberance within the flow path. In another, the flow-altering structure is a restriction in a diameter of the flow path, for example, a venturi. In yet another embodiment, the flow-altering structure is a bend in the flow path. In a further embodiment, the lysing structure at the flow rate produces turbulent flow in the lysing structure and walls of the flow path comprise a surface roughness (feature, texture, etc.) extending into the flow path beyond a turbulent flow viscous sublayer for the medium at the passive flow rate. 

[0011] Also provided herein is a method of preparing a product from an algae lysate.

In another embodiment, prior to lysing the microalgae, the microalgae is pretreated to reduce their bursting strength. According to certain embodiments, the microalgae are pretreated with either a raised temperature or lowering pH to reduce their bursting strength. 

[0012] Also provided herein is a method of lysing algae cells, comprising flowing the microalgae in the aqueous medium through the lysing structure according to any embodiment described herein.

The method comprises: inputting aqueous medium physical data including temperature, viscosity, density, and solid-fraction, into a fluid dynamics modeling system within a flow domain that geometrically defines a flow path of the aqueous medium through the lysing structure; inputting algae physical data including size and bursting strength into a particle modeling system in the flow domain; calculating stresses on the algae in the flow domain for a given aqueous medium flow rate and/or energy input through the flow path; and determining a rate of lysis of cells for the flow rate and/or energy input through the flow path. In one embodiment, the method further comprises repeating at least the steps of calculating stresses on the algae in the flow domain for a given aqueous medium flow rate and/or energy input through the flow path; and determining a rate of lysis of cells for the flow rate and/or energy input through the flow path for a different flow rate and/or energy input and/or flow domain and comparing the results to optimize cell lysis percent and flow rate and/or energy input. A non-transitory computer-readable medium comprising instructions for performing the computer-implemented method in a processor also is provided.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 

[0041] The use of numerical values in the various ranges specified in this application, unless expressly indicated otherwise, are stated as approximations as though the minimum and maximum values within the stated ranges are both preceded by the word "about". In this manner, slight variations above and below the stated ranges can be used to achieve substantially the same results as values within the ranges. Also, unless indicated otherwise, the disclosure of ranges is intended as a continuous range including every value between the minimum and maximum values. As used herein "a" and "an" refer to one or more. 

[0042] Provided herein are devices and methods for lysing microalgae to obtain their cell contents, such as lipids for producing biofuels and precursors thereof. As indicated above, production of biofuels from microalgae needs to become commercially practicable before it becomes an acceptable energy alternative to fossil fuels. It is therefore desirable to lyse microalgae with little or no required energy input. 

[0043] According to a first embodiment, lysing structures are provided. The lysing structures comprise a body and a fluid flow path within the body. The fluid flow path comprises one or more flow-altering structures capable of producing shear stresses able to lyse microalgae cells used in biofuels lipid production within fluid flowing through the flow path under low-energy flow. 

[0044] Considering that it takes tens, if not thousands of liters of algae culture to generate the energy equivalent of one liter of gasoline 8-10 kWh, and that a single solar panel can produce in excess of a kWh under many circumstances, the sensitivity to energy costs of algal-based biofuels is abundantly illustrated, as is the need for a passive method of cell lysis. The devices, systems and methods described herein are as energy-neutral as possible, and are a significant step in achieving economic feasibility of an algal biofuels system. Further, economic efficiencies are further enhanced by the nature of the lysis structures in that there are no moving parts or requirements for additional chemical reagents. 

[0045] In one embodiment, low-energy flow refers to gravity-feed conditions, that is at a pressure of no more than a water column of approximately 40 meters, or less than 60 psi, for example and without limitation in a range of from eight to 40 meters (26-132 feet or 11-57 psi). In the alternative, the low energy flow refers to a flow of liquid generated by 48,000 or less Joules (J) per Liter of the algae culture in the algae culture medium, and in one embodiment between 8 J and 48,000 J per Liter of the algae culture in the algae culture medium. According to another embodiment, the low energy flow refers to continuous flow rates achievable with 30 Watt (W) of power or less, for example from 5 mW to 30 W. The flow-altering structures of the fluid flow path produce laminar, turbulent, and/or cavitation flow patterns which impart sufficiently large stresses over the fluid path to rupture microalgae cells. It is not required that all cells are lysed, but that a sufficiently large portion of the cells are lysed. In one embodiment, the lysing structure lyses at least 5%, 10%, 25%, 50% or 75% of the cells at the flow rate. The remaining, unlysed cells can be discarded, recycled, recirculated, buried for carbon storage, or even lysed by active lysis methods using, for example, a mechanical screw or French press. As indicated herein, the overall goal is to reduce energy input into the lysing system and the passive lysis of a sufficiently large proportion of the cells before active lysis techniques would significantly impact production costs. 

[0046] The low energy input requirements are particular to the lysis of microalgae in the production of biofuels on a commercial scale. Typical cell culturing and cell transfer processes seek to reduce cell stress and lysis. As an example, Born et al. ("Estimation of Disruption of Animal Cells by Laminar Shear Stress," Biotechnology and Bioengineering 40:1004-1010 (1992)) illustrate stresses capable of disrupting mammalian hybridoma cells using a viscometer in the presence of dextran, a rheology modifier, that was required to achieve sufficient shear stresses. Born et al. sought to understand the limits of stress an animal cell, such as a hybridoma cell could withstand in order to prevent or minimize cell disruption in bioreactors, such as commercial bioreactors. In contrast, the methods, devices and systems seek to optimize cell lysis. 

[0047] In cases where cell lysis is required for experimentation purposes, or typical larger-scale manufacturing processes, minimizing energy is atypical. As such, mechanical presses or other active methods with higher energy requirements can be utilized. Thus, the application of low-energy/low cost lysis methods is particular to the production of lipids for biofuels, and is not a typical consideration in cell culture and processing techniques--though the current device can be used in non-biofuel applications as well. An example of a low energy input would be roughly equal to or less than the energy to lift a quantity of water or algal culture medium sufficiently high to gravity-feed the described system. As an example, the amount of energy capable of lifting a liter of water 100 feet at sea level is approximately 83 mWh (milliwatt-hours). Taking that as an example, and allowing for pumping inefficiencies, to lift a liter of water 100 feet would require less than 200 mWh. Thus, considering 100 feet elevation to be excessive for the purposes herein, energy from a single 200 W solar panel can lift thousands of gallons a day to a sufficient elevation for purposes described herein. Thus "low energy" and "low energy requirements" refers to 30 Watt or less during continuos lysing or the equivalent of a pressure of no more than a water column of approximately 40 meters, or less than 60 psi, for example and without limitation in a range of from eight to 40 meters (26-132 feet or 11-57 psi). According to a preferred embodiment, the lysing structure is gravity-fed, for example by draining of a reservoir of algae-containing liquid under the force of gravity, such as from a drain located at a lower portion or bottom of the reservoir such that flow of the liquid through the lysing structure is achieved by gravity-feed and/or from pressure derived from a water column of the reservoir. 

[0048] In the context of the lysis structures, systems and methods described herein, the shear forces to be applied to the algae cells are sufficient to rupture the cells. Different organisms and even species have different requirements for cell rupture, depending on a variety of factors including cell size and the presence of and integrity of a cell wall, the composition of which can affect the physical stresses required to rupture the cell. Table A provides examples of forces needed to rupture a variety of cell types. For reference, C. eugamentos is a microalgae.

[0049] These values were obtained from different means. Sources 2 and 4 obtain the bursting pressure by pressurizing the cells and monitoring when they burst. Source 1 and 3 used a compression test between two optic fibers. Source 5 uses a tensile test specialized for these type of samples.

[0055] The lysis structures described herein includes one or more features (flow-altering structures) capable of producing areas of turbulence and/or fluidic shear able to lyse a sufficient quantity of a particular cell, yet maintain a sufficient flow rate. For example, the lysis structure may rupture only 10% of the cells passing through, but a sample can be fed through the same structure multiple times or a series of structures such that the device number and overall percentage of cells ruptured increases. 

[0056] The body of the lysis structure may be a tube or pipe, but is a solid object with one or more flow paths comprising passages having an inlet and an outlet and a flow-altering structure therein. The passage(s) may have any geometric configuration. The body may comprise a pipe or tube having a substantially-circular cross section, as they are common plumbing supplies. Flow-altering structures include, without limitation occlusions or protuberances within the passage(s), affecting flow within the passage, bends in the passage or narrowings of the passage, which cause a restriction and/or divergent flow paths, or alterations in the wall of the fluid path that cause differentials in friction and therefore perturbations in laminar or turbulent flow, thereby producing, for example: turbulence; shear; laminar flow; rapid velocity (speed plus direction), directional or speed changes; pressure changes; and/or cavitation. Non-limiting examples of useful structures are depicted in FIG. 1. In one embodiment, the structure is a venturi, e.g., a narrowing or restriction of the fluid path followed by a subsequent expansion of the fluid path. In another embodiment, the structure comprises a surface roughness or surface features extending into the flow path. In one embodiment, the roughness disrupts a laminar or turbulent flow through the lysing structure. For example, in classical turbulent flow models, velocity profiles include four discrete layers extending from the wall: the viscous sublayer, the buffer layer, the overlap layer and the turbulent layer (See, e.g., Cengel, Y. A. and Cimbala, J. M., Fluid Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications, 1.sup.st ed., McGraw-Hill (2006), Chapter 8, "Flow in Pipes"). Therefore in one embodiment, the surface roughness extends at least beyond the turbulent flow viscous sublayer into the buffer layer in order to significantly affect flow profiles. The surface roughness may be in the form of grit or particles adhered to an inner surface of the lysing structure, ridges, etc., and the roughness may be combined with other flow-altering structures in the flow path. The result of the flow of liquids through the flow path and about the flow-altering structure(s) is localized stresses that are greater than the forces needed to rupture cells in liquid passing through the lysis structure at a flow rate that is achieved by low-energy and preferably passive means, such as by gravity flow. 

[0057] A system for passively producing an algae lysate is therefore provided, comprising a reservoir having a fluid outlet fluidly connected to a lysing structure. In one embodiment, the reservoir is a photobioreactor in which algae are grown, and in another embodiment the reservoir is an independent vessel into which the algae culture is transferred once it is propagated. Water passes through the outlet and into the lysing structure at a low flow rate. In one embodiment, the flow rate is a gravity feed flow rate that is the fluid flow rate inherent to the system when fluid is passed through the outlet and lysing structure by force of gravity, either by downhill flow of the fluid, by siphoning, or by pressure generated by the column of fluid in the reservoir. In another embodiment, a pump is used to pump fluid from the reservoir and through the lysing structure preferably using a minimum of energy, with a maximum of from 5 mW to 30 W, or gravity feed of a column of water of 40M or less (less than 60 psi), or alternately the flow is produced by an energy input of 48,000 or less Joules (J) per Liter of the fluid (e.g., algae culture in the algae culture medium), and in one embodiment between 8 J and 48,000 J per Liter of the fluid. The lysing structure has one or more flow-altering structures able to produce a physical stress capable of rupturing a microalgae cell at the flow rate. The physical stress may be due to any stress produced in the flow of the fluid media and the surface texture, resulting from, for example and without limitation, shear, turbulence or cavitation. 

[0058] As would be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, the lysing structure and flow-altering structure can have any suitable configuration so long as the structure, at the flow rate of the system, is able to lyse algae cells and, at times, extract the contents from the algae cells. FIGS. 2A, 2B and 2C show schematically alternate embodiments of a system described herein. Like reference numbers refer to similar structures. FIG. 2A shows a first schematic embodiment of system 10 for lysing algae cells. A reservoir 20 is shown containing algae-containing medium 21 filling the reservoir 20 to the fill line 22. Outlet 23 is shown having lysing structures 24. In this figure, details of the upper lysing structure 24 is shown in an expanded cross-sectional view A in which flow-altering structures 25 are depicted. Algae-containing medium passes through outlet 23, optionally controlled by a valve (not shown), such as a solenoid, and passed through the lysing structures 24, as shown by the arrows. The curved arrow in view A shows redirection of the flow of liquid through the lysing structures 24 by the flow-altering structures. This configuration produces significant pressures at the outlet and across the lysing structures due to the water column due to the height of the liquid in the reservoir. In this embodiment, at some point water would have to be raised to its final height in the reservoir. 

[0059] FIG. 2B shows schematically a second variant of the system 30, with a reservoir 40, algae-containing medium 41 and a fill-line 42, but with outlet 43 being fluidly connected to reservoir 40 just below the fill line. Fluid is pumped out of the reservoir 40 by pump 45 and through the lysing structures 44. Of note, this requires energy to power the pump 45. As described herein, the power required by the pump ranges from 5 mW to 30 W, the energy requirements are 48,000 or less Joules (J) per Liter of the algae culture in the algae culture medium, and in one embodiment between 8 J and 48,000 J per Liter of the algae culture in the algae culture medium, or the pump generates less than 60 psi). 

[0060] FIG. 2C shows schematically a second variant of the system 50, with a reservoir 60, algae-containing medium 61 and a fill-line 62, but with outlet 63 being fluidly connected to reservoir 60 as a siphon. Fluid is drawn out of the reservoir and is pulled through the lysing structures 64. There is a maximum height for the siphon. As above, a valve (not shown) may be employed to control liquid flow through the lysing structures. 

[0061] As indicated above, FIGS. 2A-2C are schematic in nature and designs may be optimized for any reason. Multiple outlets and one to hundreds, or more, lysing structures may be employed in series or in parallel to most effectively lyse cells. 

[0062] The configuration of the lysing structure is preferably optimized based on maximizing lysis at low flow rates. A computer-implemented example of such a process is provided below. The low flow rate is constrained by the maximum passively-achievable velocity--that is a velocity achievable without the assistance of a pump, such as by gravity-fed water flowing through a passage, for example under pressure of a water column of a reservoir of algae-containing medium. A maximum, passively-achievable velocity is used as a constraint in one embodiment because use of a pump requires energy input and adds an undesirable level of complexity to the system. Flowing the algae through an outlet containing the lysing structure where the outlet drains or siphons below an upper surface of liquid in the reservoir would obviate any requirement for actively pumping the liquid through the lysing structure. 

[0063] By "medium" or "media," it is meant an aqueous composition capable of sustaining growth of algae, and is typically and primarily salt water or fresh water, typically supplemented by suitable nutrients. 

[0064] According to one embodiment, a method of preparing a microalgae lysate is provided. The method comprises passively flowing a fluid comprising microalgae through a lysis structure as described herein. The fluid is flowed through the lysis structure at or below a maximum passively-achievable velocity. 

[0065] In a variation of the method, the cells are pre-treated prior to flowing the fluid through the lysing structure in order to lower the required bursting force. Many pre-treatments are expected to cost-effectively modify the algae cells so that lower forces are needed to burst the cells (Kunzek et al. "Aspects of material science in food processing: changes in plant cell walls of fruits and vegetables, Z Lebensm Unters Forsch A (1999) 208:233-250). For example, the cells may be heated prior to lysing to reduce their bursting strength (Hulsheger, H., et al. "Killing of Bacteria with Electric Pulses of High Field Strength," Radiat Environ Biophys (1981) 20:53-65 and Waugh, R, et al., "Thermoelasticity of Red Blood Cell Membrane," Biophys. J. Volume 26 Apr. 1979 115-132). Heating may be simply accomplished in a solar system, such as with a photobioreactor. Significant temperature rises can be accomplished simply by running the solution containing the cells through a typical solar water heating system akin to those used for home heating. Also, changing the pH of the solution can weaken the cells, thereby reducing their bursting strength (Valent et al. The Structure of Plant Cell Walls: V. On The Binding of Xyloglucan To Cellulose Fibers, Plant Physiol. (1974) 54, 105-108). Many acids, such as sulfuric acid, are inexpensive and can be added to the cells at any point prior to lysis, for example in a reservoir, such as a reservoir shown in FIGS. 2A-2C that is not the primary photobioreactor. Other chemical or enzymatic treatments may be employed to assist in the lysis of the algae 

[0066] In another embodiment, a method of preparing a biofuel comprising preparing a microalgae lysate, as described above and subsequently preparing a biofuel product from the lysate by extracting lipids from the lysate by any useful method, and subsequently converting the lipids to a biofuel. In one non-limiting embodiment, algae debris and water is separated from lipids (e.g., triglycerides) by settling or centrifugation. Triglycerides are hydrolyzed in a base, such as sodium hydroxide (lye) to produce fatty acids. Esterification of the fatty acids produce biodiesel, which can be accomplished by base-catalyzed transesterification with an alcohol such as methanol or ethanol, or by acid-catalyzed esterification with an alcohol. Triglycerides can be mixed with appropriate amounts of a base and an alcohol at the same time to produce biodiesel--fatty acid alkyl esters. A large variety of methods are known and understood by those of ordinary skill to extract and clarify oils from cell lysates, and producing a biofuel, such as biodiesel from the oils. 

[0067] In another embodiment, a computer-implemented method is provided for modeling lysis of algae within a lysis structure as described above. The method includes modeling an interaction between a fluid representing medium in which algae is lysed and algae cells within the physical constraints of a flow path in a lysing structure. Modeling such an interaction is performed by a modeling system comprising computer instructions implemented using any effective programming language, such as C++, and a processor. The computer instructions include instructions for modeling fluid dynamics of the algae media, instructions for modeling the algae, within the constraints/geometries of a specified flow path in a lysing structure. 

[0068] As used herein a "modeling system" is a computational framework by which an algae lysis and extraction structure or system is modeled. A modeling system embodies various elements of the algae lysis structure or system. As used herein an "element," in the context of modeling a system, means any components of the model, as described above, including, without limitation, fluid dynamic parameters, discrete element parameters, global data, initialization process data, data layers, representative grids and images, and input parameters. For example, elements of the C++ platform, described below include, for example: fluid dynamics parameters, discrete element parameters, lysing structure geometry, etc. 

[0069] Modeling systems are implemented on a computing device (computer) as processes. In the context of computing, a process is, broadly speaking any computer-implemented activity that generates an outcome, such as implementation of a mathematical or logical formula or operation, algorithm, etc. FIG. 3 illustrates one embodiment of a system 100 for implementing a modeling system. The system 100 may include a device 102 operating under the command of a controller 104. Device 102 may be referred to herein, without limitation, as a computer or computing device. The broken lines are intended to indicate that in some implementations, the controller 104, or portions thereof considered collectively, may instruct one or more elements of the device 102 to operate as described. Accordingly, the functions associated with the modeling methods (e.g., processes, software, programs) described herein may be implemented as software executing in the system 100 and controlling one or more elements thereof. An example of a device 102 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is a general-purpose computer capable of responding to and executing instructions in a defined manner. Other examples include a special-purpose computer including, for example, a personal computer (PC), a workstation, a server, a laptop computer, a web-enabled telephone, a web-enabled personal digital assistant (PDA), a microprocessor, an integrated circuit, an application-specific integrated circuit, a microprocessor, a microcontroller, a network server, a Java.TM. virtual machine, a logic array, a programmable logic array, a micro-computer, a mini-computer, or a large frame computer, or any other component, machine, tool, equipment, or some combination thereof capable of responding to and executing instructions. 

[0070] In one non-limiting embodiment, system 100 is implemented as a PC. Furthermore, the system 100 may include a central processing engine including a baseline processor, memory, and communications capabilities. The system 100 also may include a communications system bus to enable multiple processors to communicate with each other. In addition, the system 100 may include storage 106 in the form of computer readable medium/media, such as a disk drive, disk, optical drive, a solid state drive, a tape drive, flash memory (e.g., a non-volatile computer storage chip), cartridge drive, and control elements for loading new software. In embodiments of the invention, one or more reference values may be stored in a memory associated with the device 102. Data, such as images produced by the methods and systems described herein may be organized on computer readable media in a database, which is an organized collection of data for one or more purposes, usually in digital form. In one embodiment, any or all software, data, code, processes, controllers, algorithms, instructions, etc. are stored non-transiently on a computer-readable medium. 

[0071] Embodiments of the controller 104 may include, for example, a program, code, a set of instructions, or some combination thereof, executable by the device 102 for independently or collectively instructing the device 102 to interact and operate as programmed, referred to herein as "programming instructions". One example of a controller 104 is a software application (for example, operating system, browser application, client application, server application, proxy application, on-line service provider application, and/or private network application) installed on the device 102 for directing execution of instructions. In one embodiment, the controller 104 may be a Windows.TM. based operating system. The controller 104 may be implemented by utilizing any suitable computer language (e.g., C\C++, UNIX SHELL SCRIPT, PERL, JAVA.TM., JAVASCRIPT, HTML/DHTML/XML, FLASH, WINDOWS NT, UNIX/LINUX, APACHE, RDBMS including ORACLE, INFORMIX, and MySQL) and/or object-oriented techniques. 

[0072] In one embodiment, the controller 104 may be embodied permanently or temporarily in any type of machine, component, physical or virtual equipment, storage medium, or propagated signal capable of delivering instructions to the device 102. In particular, the controller 104 (e.g., software application, and/or computer program) may be stored on any suitable computer readable media (e.g., disk, device, or propagated signal), readable by the device 102, such that if the device 102 reads the storage medium, the functions described herein are performed. For example, in one embodiment, the controller 104 may be embodied in various computer-readable media for performing the functions associated with processes embodying the modeling methods. 

[0073] In one embodiment, the software is written and developed using a programming language, such as the C++ computing language. An integrated development environment (IDE), such as "DevC++, is used to write the code. The developed software generates large text files with data about the flow field (e.g., pressure and velocity), the algae positions in the flow, and the number of lysed algae cells. To visualize the fluid and the algae, a data visualizer is used, such as the opensource Paraview tool from Kitware, Inc. of Clifton Park, N.Y. Finally, our software is setup to take into it an arbitrary computational mesh to represent the occlusion. The occlusion, such as a sphere described below in the examples is created in computer-aided design (CAD) software, such as SOLIDWORKS.RTM. from Fisher/Unitech of Troy, Mich. A person of ordinary skill in the art of computer programming and engineering will be able to develop and implement software capable of carrying out the tasks/operations described herein. 

[0074] A flow diagram of one embodiment of the computer-implemented method is shown in FIG. 4. The computer-implemented method comprises modeling fluid dynamics within the flow domain of the supernatant. The flow domain is defined geometrically by the walls or lumen of the lysing structure, and includes any flow-altering structure of the lysing structure, such as an occlusion, a restriction, an expansion, a wall roughness or a bending of the flow path. The method also comprises modeling algae cells as discrete elements within the flow domain. The method calculates stresses on the algae cells due to the flow as forces. Data useful for the fluid dynamic modeling include fluid viscosity, density and flow rate. Fluid viscosity and density is approximated in one embodiment by density and viscosity values for fresh water (e.g., 992-1000 kg/m.sup.3 and 0.0007-0.0013 Pa-s) or salt water (e.g., 1028-1013 kg/m.sup.3 and 0.0006-0.0015 Pa-s), depending upon the growth medium of the algae cells. Algae properties include, without limitation, diameter (e.g., length, width, and height), density, volume, velocity and drag. Properties of the lumen or internal surface of the lysing structure through which the fluid flows, in addition to geometric features includes friction or drag, which can significantly impact fluid dynamics. The "strength," that is, the stresses needed to rupture or lyse the algae cells also is relevant when modeling the degree of lysis of algae in an algae culture. By including the strength of the cells, flow regions where stresses exceed that threshold can be mapped and maximized. Table A, above, provides examples of bursting strength of certain cell types. 

[0075] According to another embodiment, a non-transitory computer readable medium having stored thereon instructions is provided. The instructions, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to implement a computer-implemented method as described above, for optimizing lysis of cells in a lysing structure.

Example 1 

Atomic Force Microscopy to Probe Microalgal Elastic Response 

[0076] The mechanical properties of microalga, Scenedesmus dimorphus, were investigated through Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) to determine the elastic response of cells that were in an aqueous and dried state using local nano-scale indentation. We determined the Young's Modulus of single-celled S. dimorphus cells to be 2.21.+-.0.40 MPa when in an aqueous state and 57.96.+-.7.20 MPa in a dried state. FIG. 5 shows a force/distance curve generated by an AFM. FIG. 6 shows images of S. dimorphus on an AFM and respective force/distance curves. 

[0077] We used the microalgal strain Scenedesmus dimorphus, which has many applications including its use in biomass and wastewater treatment applications. (P. Chevalier and J. de la Noue, "Wastewater nutrient removal with microalgae immobilized in carrageenan," Enzyme and Microb. Technol., vol. 7, no. 12, pp. 621-625, 1985) While present in freshwater, S. dimorphus can also grow in domestic sewage. These variations of growing conditions can cause phenotypical changes allowing these 10 .mu.m long microorganisms to grow in colonies or alone in crescent, bi-convex, rounded tetrad, or circular shapes. (G. Oron, G. Shelef and A. Levi, "Environmental phenotypic variation of Scenedesmus dimorphus in high-rate algae ponds and its relationship to wastewater treatment and biomass production," Biotechnology and bioengineering, vol. 23, no. 10, pp. 2185-2198, 1981) The molecular composition of S. dimorphus varies as well such as for protein, carbohydrates, and lipids are 8-18%, 21-52%, and 16-40% by dry weight, respectively. (T. Bruton, H. Lyons, Y. Lerat, M. Stanley and M. B. Rasmussen, "A review of the potential of marine algae as a source of biofuel in Ireland," Sustainable Energy Ireland, Dublin, 2009). 

[0078] To probe the mechanical properties of these microorganisms, atomic force microscope (AFM) was employed, which enabled high resolution imaging as well as force measurements when obtaining mechanical properties. (Y. F. Dufrene, "Atomic force microscopy, a powerful tool in microbiology," Journal of Bacteriology, vol. 184, no. 19, pp. 5205-5213, 2002) Mechanical properties, like elastic modulus, of various biological materials have been obtained through AFM previously including that for mouse embryonic stem cells and yeast cells, which have elastic moduli values of 17.87 kPa and 0.6 MPa, respectively. (A. J. Heim, W. G. Matthews and T. J. Koob, "Determination of the elastic modulus of native collagen fibrils via radial indentation," Applied Physics Letters, vol. 89, no. 18, 2006; H. Ladjal, J.-L. Hanus, A. Pillarisetti, C. Keefer, A. Ferreira and J. P. Desai, "Atomic force microscopy-based single-cell indentation: experimentation and finite element simulation," in IEEE, St. Louis, 2009; and A. Touhami, B. Nysten and Y. F. Dufrene, "Nanoscale mapping of the elasticity of microbial cells by atomic force microscopy," Langmuir, vol. 19, no. 11, pp. 4539-4543, 2003). 

[0079] We cultured S. dimorphus (UTEX algae culture collection) in Modified Bold 3N and Proteose media. For AFM imaging, glass slides were plasma cleaned and for the aqueous experiments, they were treated with 0.01% poly-1-lysine solution to enhance cell adhesion. The dried samples were inoculated from the culture grown on proteose agar medium and allowed to dry on the slides. Both imaging and nanoindentation on the S. dimorphus cells were performed on an Asylum Research MFP-3D AFM under ambient air at room temperature. Two types of cantilevers were used in the probing of the hydrated and dehydrated S. dimorphus cells, having spring constants ranging from 0.08-0.26 N/m and 0.5-4.4 N/m, respectively. The specific spring constants for the cantilevers used were calculated using the Sader method (J. E. Sader, J. W. M. Chon and P. Mulvaney, "Calibration of rectangular atomic force microscope cantilevers," Review of Scientific Instruments, vol. 70, no. 10, pp. 3967-3969, 1999) implemented with the Asylum Research software. 

[0080] FIG. 7A shows a representative AFM 3D height image showing the surface topography of a dried S. dimorphus cell. FIG. 7B shows AFM topographical image of a typical single, dried S. dimorphus cell with points 1, 2, and 3 selected for nanoindentation to determine the Young's Modulus. 

[0081] Before nanoindentation, a single, dried cell was imaged in air using the stiffer cantilever to obtain the representative 3D height image shown in FIG. 9A. Next, the nanoindentation was initiated at select points on the cell to determine the mechanical properties (FIG. 9B). A minimum of ten measurements was taken at each location. Utilizing Igor Pro software, approach data from these indentations were analyzed using relationships for a Hertzian contact model, which has previously implemented. (H. Ladjal, J.-L. Hanus, A. Pillariseti, C. Keefer, A. Ferreira and J. P. Desai, "Atomic force microscopy-based single-cell indentation: experimentation and finite element simulation," in RSJ International Converence on Intelligent Robot Systems, St. Louis, 2009). 

[0082] A representative force vs. indentation plot with the Hertzian contact model approximation applied is shown in FIG. 8A. After accumulating the force-indentation data from the three points of a cell, histogram plots were determined to project the variation in the data (FIG. 8B). This histogram shows a normal distribution of Young's modulus values with a mean value of 36.72 MPa with a standard distribution of 10.71 MPa. 

[0083] FIG. 8A shows a representative AFM force vs indentation approach curve from a defined nanoindentation location on single, dried S. dimorphus cell. In this experiment, the Young's modulus was calculated to be 26.85 MPa using a Hertzian contact model. FIG. 8B shows a histogram of binned Young's Modulus values from the designated locations on the same cell. 

[0084] For cells in solution, a representative force versus indentation curve is shown in FIG. 9A. The results have a close fit when implementing the Hertzian approximation resulting in a Young's modulus of approximately 3.95 MPa. Similar to the dried cells, a histogram plot was generated from the multiple nanoindentations on single dried cell (FIG. 9B). The histogram of dried cell Young's modulus values appear to be more broadly distributed, which may be due to the differences in viscoelastic properties that may be more prevalent when they are in solution versus dried. 

[0085] FIG. 9A shows a representative AFM force vs indentation approach curve for a S. dimorphus cell in solution. The Young's modulus here was calculated to be 3.95 MPa using a Hertzian contact model assumption. FIG. 9B shows a histogram of binned Young's Modulus values from the representative locations on the same cell. 

[0086] After analyzing the results from both cell types, the Young's moduli values were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (p.ltoreq.0.05) for S. dimorphus. For the dried cells, the Young's modulus was calculated to be 57.96.+-.7.20 MPa (mean.+-.standard deviation of the mean) with a standard deviation (or data spread) of 36.55 MPa. The Young's modulus value for aqueous S. dimorphus cells is 2.21.+-.0.40 MPa with a standard deviation of 2.25 MPa (FIG. 10). 

[0087] FIG. 10 shows a comparison of dried and aqueous Young's modulus measurements of Scendesmus dimorphus cells. The error bars represent standard deviation with p.ltoreq.0.05. 

[0088] In conclusion, we were able to both image and determine the elastic properties for Scenedesmus dimorphus cells using an AFM as both dried and in solution with a result of 57.96.+-.7.20 MPa and 2.21.+-.0.40 MPa, respectively. In addition, comparing the dry and aqueous states for algae shows a significant difference in their elastic properties. These findings may be particularly important for cell lysis especially for the diversity of industries where this may be applicable including dietary supplements, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and biofuel. We believe that these findings will be important to researchers in physics, biology, engineering, and chemistry. 

Example 2 

[0089] One step in processing algae for biofuel is successfully rupturing the algae cell so that it can release its lipid content, the main energy component of the cell. Currently, this process is very energy-intensive, thus commercial, algal biofuel usage is on halt. To obtain a better understanding this process, mechanical characterization of the microalgal cell must be performed so that mechanical lysing can be analyzed. 

[0090] With this work, we hope to bring a greater understanding of the mechanical properties of microalgae in order to make algal biofuel processing more efficient. Using an Asylum Research MFP-3D AFM, we have imaged algal strain S. dimorphus and determined its Young's modulus in both its hydrated and dehydrated forms, 2.21.+-.0.40*MPa and 57.96.+-.7.20*MPa respectively. The Young's modulus is necessary for computational modeling evaluated with a Particle Flow and Tribology Laboratory in-house code. This model would allow us to further optimize microalgal cell lysis for biofuel processing. 

[0091] In addition to our experimentation with atomic force microscopy, we have also proven that shear stress aids in the lysis of microalgal cells utilizing a Tecan Safire II spectrophotometer. Using Bodipy 505/515, a green lipophilic fluorescent dye, we were able to stain the lipid components of the cells and perform various cell disruption techniques including microwave, sonication, and shearing between glass and aluminum surfaces. Once the disruption was concluded, we filtered the solutions and used the spectrophotometer to determine the absorbance Bodipy 505/515 remaining in the precipitate. This revealed that shearing worked significantly better than the other methods employed. 

Calculating Young's Modulus 

[0092] 3D images of a single dried S. dimorphus cell were taken and are shown in FIG. 11. FIG. 12 shows topography image from Asylum Research MFP-3D-AFM with points selected for indentation. The cell shown in FIG. 12 is the same cell as shown in FIG. 11. Young's Modulus was obtained, as shown in FIG. 13A. FIG. 13B provides young's moduli for various materials ([1] Radmacher, M., "Measuring the Elastic Properties of Biological Samples with the AFM," IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology March/April 1997, pp. 47-57; [2] Eaton, P., et al. "Atomic force microscopy study of the antibacterial effects of chitosans on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus," Ultramicroscopy 108 (2008) 1128-1134; [3] Tuson, H. H., et al.

Disruption Tests 

Preparation 

[0093] Algae were allowed to absorb dye for approximately 1 week. Then the viability of the dye was checked by examining the fluorescence. The algae and dye were spun down and the dye solution was replaced with dH.sub.2O. The same exposure (0.3) was kept throughout for imaging for consistency. The magnification was increased to 63.times. (2.5.times. was on for a total 157.5.times.). FIG. 14 shows S. Dimorphus with Bodipy dye under bright field (FIG. 14A) and fluorescence (FIG. 14B) microscopy. This microscopy was undertaken to ensure that the cells absorbed the Bodipy dye. 

Disruption Methods 

[0094] There were four disruption methods investigated to compare their effectiveness: sonication, frothing, microwave, and manual shearing via metal flat punch. The microalgae slurry was placed in a sonicator for 14 minutes (as described in the literature). The algae solution is poured into 80 mL beaker for the frothing disruption test. A frother was used on the microalgae slurry for 7 minutes. The microwave was utilized for a total of 7 minutes as well. However, due to the evaporation of the dH.sub.2O, this disruption method required 3 times more microalgal slurry to obtain enough of a sample to be used in the analysis via spectrophotometry. The fourth disruption method used was shear via a metal flat punch whose diameter was approximately 1.5 inches. The slurry was sheared between the flat punch and a glass petri dish for 7 minutes. 

[0095] The microalgae solutions were removed from their respective disruption tests with needle and syringe and a drop of each sample was placed on a coverslip. A 0.22 .mu.m filter was used for the remainder of the tested microalgal slurry to remove intact cells and debris before measurement. The microalgal slurry obtained from the flat punch shear test was filtered twice to ensure only subcellular parts were used in the following optical density tests. Optical density measurements were undertaken with a Tecan Safire Photospectrometer (Tecan, Mannedorf, SU). The Bodipy dye used to stain the algal lipids becomes excited between 450-490 nm. Three controls were included: 1.5 ml dH.sub.2O to 0.5 .mu.l Bodipy; dH.sub.2O; and blank wells within 96-well microplate. The results (FIG. 15) show that shearing is a good candidate for algal cell lysing. 

Example 3 

Prediction of Stress Values Suitable to Lyse Cells in Cell Lysis Experiments 

[0096] In this document, a quick study is presented on the methods used in the software to achieve stresses which are equivalent to stress values from the literature which are known to lyse cells. The details of the software have been provided in previous documents. Here, only the methods used to achieve these stresses and the resulting velocity field and pressure field in the flow will be discussed. Cell lysis by fluid shear is can be accomplished by subjecting cells to a flow with sufficient shear stress to rupture their membrane (Born et al., 1992). This was accomplished by Born et al. in 1992 who used a viscometer to impart known shear stresses to animal cells. Born et al. subjected the animal cells to flows with shear stress values between 124 N/m.sup.2 and 577 N/m.sup.2 and recorded the percentage of cells which were lysed. They also compared this value to an analytical model they developed and found very good agreement. 

[0097] This data from Born et al. indicates that 200 N/m.sup.2 is sufficient to lyse approximately 45% of the cells they tested. As such, in the current software it was desired to achieve shear stress values of 200 N/m.sup.2 to provide evidence that the software, and the device configuration, are capable of producing stress values large enough to lyse actual cells. To accomplish this goal, the software was configured in the same manner as in previous studies. To produce large stress values, the inlet flow velocity was set to 2500 mm/s. As the fluid moved through the domain, it accelerated and sheared due to the occlusion. The resulting shear stress contour plot and quantitative stress values are displayed in FIG. 16. 

[0098] In FIG. 16, it is clear that the software can predict stress levels in excess of 200 N/m.sup.2. As a result of the experimental data provided by Born et al., it is believed that cells placed in the simulated flow in regions of stress in excess of 200 N/m.sup.2 would be lysed. 

To get a better understanding of the flow field, the pressure and the velocity in the domain are provided in FIG. 17, which shows flow characteristics in the device domain. FIG. 17A shows a contour plot of the velocity field. FIG. 17B shows a contour plot of the pressure field. In FIG. 17, velocity contour and pressure contour plots are displayed. From FIG. 17A, it is clear to see that the flow accelerates as it moves past the occlusion. In FIG. 17B, the pressure drop in the domain is displayed. In this work, evidence is provided that to show that software can predict stresses suitable for lysing cells. 

Example 4 

A Method of Predicting Energy Consumption During Cell Disruption and Lipid Extraction for Algae-Based Biofuel Production 

[0099] In the current work, a computational framework is proposed to predict the energy consumed during mechanical cell disruption for algae-based biofuel production. Fluid-induced shear stress applied to the cell is simulated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The motion of the individual algae cells is simulated with the discrete element method (DEM). The energy consumed and lysing efficiency are recorded. The model predicted that as energy consumption is increased, more of the algae cells in the domain are disrupted. It was also found that the model can be used to predict the areas in the flow where lysing is most likely to occur. Such information can be used to design novel cell disruptor configurations which minimize energy consumption. 

Methodology 

[0100] To predict fluid-induced algae cell lysis, it is important to model both the fluid and the algae cells. For the fluid, an in-house numerical solver is developed. To simulate the algae cells, a Lagrangian particle modeling approach is employed. In this section, the details for each technique are provided. Data was generated using custom-developed in DevC++. Data was visualized in Paraview. Geometric structures were created in SOLIDWORKS.RTM.. 

Supernatant Modeling 

[0101] The supernatant, in which the algae grow, consists primarily of water and a small amount of nutrients. In practice, it is believed that this fluid can be used as the medium to induce lysis for lipid release by imparting shear stresses on the algae cell. In the current framework, the supernatant is modeled using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The Chorin projection is used to numerically approximate the Navier-Stokes equations (Chorin, A. J., Numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. Mathematics of Computation 1968, 22, (104), 745-762 and Griebel, M. et al., Numerical Simulation in Fluid Dynamics. Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM): Philadelphia, 1998; p 217). Beginning with the momentum equations, (1a), (1b), and (1c), an explicit Euler time-stepping algorithm is used to solve for the new velocity components, on a staggered grid, at each successive time-step. The variables u,v,w, and p represent the x,y,z components of the fluid velocity and the pressure, respectively.

[0102] Pressure-velocity coupling is achieved by satisfying the continuity equation (Eq. (2)). The pressure at each time-step is solved through the successive over-relaxation (SOR) method. 

Algae Modeling The algae are modeled using the discrete element method (DEM). DEM was first developed by Cundall and Strack in 1979 and has been used for a number of particle modeling applications (Mpagazehe, J. N.; Queiruga, A. F.; Higgs, C. F., Towards an understanding of the drilling process for fossil fuel energy: A continuum discrete approach. Tribology International 2012, Article in Press; Zhang, H.; Tan, Y.; Yang, D.; Trias, F. X.; Jiang, S.; Sheng, Y.; Oliva, A., Numerical investigation of the location of maximum erosive wear damage in elbow: Effect of slurry velocity, bend orientation and angle of elbow. Powder Technology 2012, 217, 467-476; Cundall, P. A.; Strack, O. D. L., Discrete Numerical Model for Granular Assemblies. Geotechnique 1979, 29, (1), 47-65; and Rojek, J., Discrete Element Modelling of Rock Cutting. Computer Methods in Materials Science 2007, 7, (2), 224-230).sup.7-10. In DEM, particles are represented as discrete entities with properties such as radius, mass, position, and velocity. When it is found that the particle centers are at a distance less than the sum of their radii, a collision is performed. To calculate the forces on the particles after a collision, the classic spring-dashpot model is used. This model is illustrated in FIG. 18. In FIG. 18, a collision between two particles is depicted. When Particles collides with Particel.sub.2, Eq. (3) is used to resolve the forces on the particles from the collisions. 

F.sub.collison=K.sub.springU.sub.springU.sub.spring-V.sub.n-B.sub.dashpo- t (3) 

In Eq. (3) K.sub.spring and B.sub.dashpot, the spring and damping constants respectively, are specified depending on whether the collision is with other particles or with the boundaries. The numerical integration scheme used to update particle velocities and positions is the explicit Euler integration technique. In the current model, the spring constant and damping parameters are set to zero. Experimental investigations can be performed to provide an appropriate estimate for these parameters for algae. 

Fluid Forces on Algae 

[0103] As the supernatant flows around the algae, it exerts forces on it. In the current model, the forces from the supernatant serve two purposes; (1) the forces from the supernatant act to advect algae cells through the domain, and (2) the forces from the supernatant exert shear stresses on the algae which, if larger than the algae shear strength, will cause the algae cell membrane to rupture. A DEM particle, representing an algae cell, surrounded by a CFD element is depicted in FIG. 19. In FIG. 19, the velocity of the supernatant below the algae cell is denoted as U.sub.1. The velocity of the supernatant above the algae cell is denoted as U.sub.2. The drag forces which advect the algae cell in the domain are calculated from Stokes drag (Eq. (4)). 

F.sub.drag=3.pi..eta.dU (4) 

In Eq. (4), .eta. is the viscosity of the supernatant, d is the diameter of the algae cell, and U is the relative velocity between the fluid and the cell. In the instance depicted in FIG. 19, U.sub.1 for Eq. (4) is calculated as the difference between the algae cell's velocity and the average of U.sub.1 and U.sub.2. As the flow moves around the algae cell, it imparts shear stresses on the algae cell's surface. A portion of this shear stress acts to move the algae cell in the domain (drag). For simplicity, the shear stress which contributes to cell disruption is calculated independently from the drag and is based upon the velocity gradient across the algae cell. This calculation is displayed in Eq. (5). 

.tau. = 6 .eta. ( U 2 - U 1 ) ( d ) ( 5 ) ##EQU00002## 

In Eq. (5), .tau. represents the shear stress on the cell. The formulation is derived by assuming a Stokes drag force acting on half of a cell due to the velocity gradient across the cell. Though this formulation captures the velocity gradient across the cell, which is the dominant phenomenon contributing to the shear stress on the cell, a higher fidelity approximation can be incorporated into the model at a later date. However, for the purpose of modeling physics-based algae lysing with the current framework, Eq. (5) suffices as a means to simulate this behavior. In the model, a shear strength for the algae is prescribed. As the simulation runs, .tau. is calculated at each time-step. If .tau. is found to be larger than the prescribed algae shear strength, then the algae are determined to have been lysed. 

Calculating Power Consumption 

[0104] Because the velocity gradient across the algae cell is important in calculating the shear stress being applied to it, an obstacle was placed in the flow to generate different velocity gradients. The computational domain with the obstacle is displayed in FIG. 20A. In FIG. 20B, the computational mesh for the CFD is displayed. In FIG. 20A the fluid domain is shown as an outline around the obstacle placed in flow, and in FIG. 20B the fluid domain is shown as a wireframe to display CFD mesh. 

[0105] In this work, the occlusion ration, .phi., is defined as the ratio of the height of the domain that is blocked to the total height of the domain. This parameter is varied by moving the obstacle in the flow to higher or lower positions which occupy different portions of the domain. When .phi. is large, it means a large portion of the flow is occluded by the obstacle. Conversely, when .phi. is small, it means a small portion of the flow is occluded by the obstacle. In FIG. 21, the effect of varying this parameter is depicted. The occlusion ratios are set to 0.2 (FIG. 21A), 0.6 (FIG. 21B), or 0.8 (FIG. 21C). The power consumption is calculated as the power it would take for a pump to maintain the specified flow rate in the domain. This is calculated as the product of the pressure drop across the length obstacle, .DELTA.P, and the volumetric flow rate, Q. This relationship is displayed in Eq. (6). 

Power Input=.DELTA.P*Q (6) 

Changing the occlusion ratio affects the pressure drop and therefore the power input necessary to maintain the constant flow rate, Q. However, changing the occlusion ratio also affects the local velocity gradients across the computational cells, or strain-rates, which affects the stress imparted to the algae. In this way, the power consumption and the algae cell disruption are both predicted in the current framework. 

Results and Discussion 

[0106] In this section, the results from the model are presented. A series of simulations were run in which the occlusion ratio was varied between 0 and 0.8. The algae were seeded in random locations, and each occlusion ratio was run 3 times. The power consumed for each occlusion ratio and the percentage of algae lysed is reported. In Table 1, the input parameters used in the model are presented. 

TABLE-US-00002 TABLE 1 Model Input Parameters Algae Properties Diameter (.mu.m) 30.0 Density (kg/m.sup.3) 1000.0 Supernatant Properties Viscosity (Pa-s) 0.001 Density (kg/m.sup.3) 1000.0 Algae Shear Cell Parameters Length (.mu.m) 3000.0 Width (.mu.m) 500.0 Height (.mu.m) 500.0 Inlet Velocity (.mu.m/s) 25000.0 

[0107] Only moderate consideration was used to reconcile the properties of the algae and the supernatant to properties observed in experiments. However, the algae size and the supernatant viscosity are two critical parameters in the simulation and their values of 30 microns and 0.001 Pa-s, respectively, are close to actual values found in experiments. To ensure a closer match of algae dimensions and material properties, future simulations will be run to match parameters which represent experimental data even more closely. 

[0108] The initial conditions for the simulation were prescribed such that supernatant began at rest and a boundary condition was imposed on the inlet side (left side in FIG. 22B) of 25 mm/s. Once the simulation started, it took some time for the flow field to achieve steady-state. Due to concern with observing cell disruption when the flow was developed, the supernatant was allowed to flow in the domain for 20 ms while the algae were held stationary. After 20 ms, the flow of the supernatant was developed and the algae were allowed to be advected throughout the domain due to drag forces with the supernatant. It should be noted that significant cell disruption may occur as the flow develops due to an unsteady pattern of the flow. Therefore, intermittently starting and stopping the flow may create conditions favorable for cell wall disruption and this phenomenon could be explored in more detail. Images of the supernatant streamlines and algae, as they flow over the obstacle, are displayed in FIG. 22, which shows supernatant streamlines and algae as they move around the obstacle after 60 ms of simulation time. In FIG. 22A, a trimetric view is displayed. In FIG. 22B, a side view is displayed 

[0109] To better illustrate the motion of the algae as they move through the domain, images from the simulation are displayed at various times in FIG. 23. FIG. 23 shows algae positions and supernatent velocity magnitude contour at different times during the simulation. Intact algae are displayed in green, lysed algae are red. Shown are initial conditions (FIG. 23A), after 20 ms (FIG. 23 B), after 40 ms (FIG. 23C), after 60 ms FIG. 23D), and after 80 ms (FIG. 23E). 

[0110] In FIG. 23A, the algae can be seen in their initial position and the supernatant is stationary. In FIG. 6b, the flow in the domain is steady, and the increase in supernatant velocity can be seen as it passes over the obstacle. The supernatant velocity increases to conserve mass as it moves through the constricted region above the obstacle. In the rest of the images of FIG. 23, it can be seen that the algae positions advance in the domain due to drag with the supernatant. Any of the algae which experience a shear stress, calculated from Eq. (5), that exceeds their shear strength, turn from green to red. As the algae pass over the obstacle, only some of the algae are lysed. This can be seen in FIG. 23E where some of the algae that have passed the obstacle are red and some remain green. More detail about when cells are found to be lysed and when they are not is provided in the following sections. From the model, it is possible to ascertain the cumulative percentage of lysed cells vs. time. This data can be seen in FIG. 24. 

[0111] It can be seen in FIG. 24, that it took approximately 50 ms before any algae were lysed. This is because, the algae were held stationary for 20 ms while the flow developed. Once the algae began to move, it took some time for them to pass into the high strain-rate region above the obstacle. It should also be noted, that not all of the algae were lysed. The simulations were run for about 200 ms which allowed approximately 97% of the algae cells to pass the obstacle. The algae which did not pass the obstacle became trapped in the regions of low supernatant velocity on the surface of the obstacle or on the lower wall immediately before the obstacle. 

Pressure Drop Across the Obstacle 

[0112] The pressure drop across the obstacle is important in calculating the power consumed to maintain the constant supernatant velocity flow rate Eq. (6). In FIG. 25, the pressure drop across the length of the domain is displayed. This pressure is plotted along the white line in FIG. 25A. The figure shows contour of the pressure in the domain (FIG. 25A) and a graph of the pressure drop across the length of the domain (FIG. 25B) 

[0113] Beginning at the left side of FIG. 25B, it can be seen that the pressure starts low and then increases to about 1000 g/(s.sup.2 mm). The reason for this increase at the far left side of the domain is due to the numerical application of the fixed velocity boundary condition. The domain was chosen to be long enough so that this rise in pressure would be negligible when compared to the supernatant's behavior in the rest of the domain. Before and after the obstacle, FIG. 25 displays a linear pressure drop. This is because of the friction with the walls in the domain. The primary pressure drop occurs across the obstacle. Depending on the occlusion ratio, the magnitude of this pressure drop changes. For larger occlusion ratios, the pressure drop is larger. For smaller occlusion ratios, the pressure drop is smaller. This phenomenon agrees with intuition as the larger the occlusion ration, the more resistance the supernatant experiences as it moves through the domain. The increase in resistance in the domain correlates to an increase in the required pumping power (Eq. (6). 

Energy Efficiency of Cell Disruption 

[0114] The objective of the current work is to develop a computational framework that can be used to minimize the energy input into the system while lysing the maximum number of cells. To understand how the energy consumption is related to the number of algae cells lysed, a case study was performed in which the occlusion ratio was varied. Accordingly, the energy consumed and the percentage of algae cells lysed was recorded. The results of this study are displayed in FIG. 26, which shows power input vs. percentage of algae lysed. 

[0115] In FIG. 26, each data point corresponds to a different occlusion ratio. It can be seen that as the occlusion ratio, .phi., increases, more power is needed to maintain a constant flow rate. Also, as the occlusion ratio increases, a larger percentage of the algae are lysed. The reason for this is because larger occlusion ratios mean greater strain-rates in the flow. As the occlusion ratio increases, the flow must move faster as it flows around the boundary to conserve mass. The faster flow creates higher strain-rates. Understanding the relationship between the power input and the percentage of algae lysed is important for the practical design of devices which are intended to disrupt cell membranes through fluid-induced shear stresses. 

[0116] In addition to predicting the percentage of algae lysed, the model described in this work can also be used to understand how the flow configuration affects the strain-rate of the supernatant. Plotting the strain-rate directly can elucidate the locations in the flow where lysing is most likely to occur. An example of this is shown in FIG. 27. 

Investigating the Strain-Rate in the Domain 

[0117] FIG. 27 shows the contour of the strain-rate of the fluid in the domain (FIG. 27A) and a graph of the strain rate across the length of the domain (FIG. 27B). In FIG. 27B, the strain-rate is plotted along the line shown in FIG. 27A. In FIG. 27B, it can be seen that the strain-rate is low in the beginning of the domain. Once the flow reaches the obstacle, there is a spike in the strain-rate. Once the flow is past the obstacle, the strain-rate decreases. It is of interest to note that although the strain-rate is maximized in the region above the obstacle, the strain-rate in this region varies greatly. The strain-rate is highest near the wall of the domain and the obstacle. However, there is an area in this region where the flow is able to move with little impedance from the walls. This area is denoted with an arrow in FIG. 10a. Algae which pass through this area do not experience a region of high strain-rate and thus are less likely to be lysed. The designers of an experimental device to disrupt the cell walls of algae will want to minimize the presence of such regions. 

CONCLUSION 

[0118] In this work, a computational framework was developed to predict the lysing of algae cells. A virtual algae shear cell was created to determine the efficiency of lysing. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and the discrete element method (DEM) were used to model the supernatant and the algae, respectively. The energy input into the system was calculated by observing the pressure drop across an obstacle placed in the flow to modify the local strain-rates. A correlation was found among the percentage of the domain that was occluded, the energy consumed, and the percentage of algae lysed. Such a framework can be used in the future to optimize the flow configuration such that shear stress from the fluid can be used to lyse algae cells with minimal power input. Along with this framework, experiments would need to be conducted so that mechanical properties, such as the ultimate shear strength of the algae, can be used as a parameter in the model.

[0119] The present invention has been described in accordance with several examples, which are intended to be illustrative in all aspects rather than restrictive. Thus, the present invention is capable of many variations in detailed implementation, which may be derived from the description contained herein by a person of ordinary skill in the art.

SEQUENCE LISTING 

[0003] The instant application contains a Sequence Listing which has been submitted electronically in ASCII format and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Said ASCII copy, created on Dec. 11, 2015, is named 101700-0111_SL.txt and is 5,969 bytes in size. 

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 

[0004] PNAs are a class of nucleic acid mimics in which the naturally occurring sugar phosphodiester backbone is replaced with N-(2-aminoethyl) glycine units. See Nielsen, P. E.; et. al., Science 1991, 254, 1497-1500. Because of the homomorphous nature of the backbone and linker, PNAs can hybridize to complementary DNA and RNA through normal Watson-Crick base-pairing just as the natural counterparts, but with higher affinity and sequence selectivity. See Egholm, M., et al., Nature 1993, 365, 566-568. 

[0005] PNAs are also capable of invading selected sequences of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) attributed in large part to the lack of electrostatic repulsion between the PNA and DNA strands. While the underlying mechanism for high sequence selectivity of a PNA hybrid with either a DNA or RNA is not fully understood, structural studies suggested that hydration may play a key role in binding and selectivity. For instance, X-ray structural data of PNA-DNA and PNA-RNA duplexes indicates that a molecule of water bridges the amide proton in the backbone to the adjacent nucleobase rigidifying the PNAs backbone and preventing sequence mismatches thereby making the sequence mismatch less accommodating. 

[0006] In addition the ability of PNAs to hybridize to DNA or RNA with high sequence selectivity, biochemical studies indicate that PNAs posses enhanced nucleolytic and proteolytic stability, most likely due to their unnatural backbone that prevents or slows down the physiological degradation of PNA's by proteases or nucleases. 

[0007] Despite the many appealing features that make PNAs attractive as molecular reagents for biology, biotechnology and medicine, PNAs have some drawbacks as compared to other classes of oligonucleotides. PNAs have a charge neutral backbone as a result of which PNAs have poor water solubility, the propensity to aggregate and adhere to surfaces and adhere to other macromolecules in a nonspecific manner. This inherent property of non-specific aggregation and surface adherence presents a technical challenge for the handling and processing of PNAs. 

[0008] While considerable efforts have been made to address these problems, several of the prior art efforts have focused on incorporating charged amino acid residues at the termini or in the interior of a PNA oligomer, the inclusion of polar groups in the backbone, the replacement of the original aminoethylglycyl backbone skeleton with a negatively-charged scaffold, the conjugation of high molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG) to one of the oligomer termini, or fusion of a PNA to a DNA to generate a chimeric oligomer to improve water solubility. However, these chemical modifications are often achieved at the expense of binding affinity and/or sequence specificity. 

[0009] Additionally, the high costs associated with synthesis of PNAs has limited their incorporation as reagents routinely used in diagnostic assays, gene therapy and other biochemical assays. 

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 

[0010] The present invention addresses drawbacks of the conventional technology by providing a hydrophilic PNA moiety with improved hybridization properties, water solubility and biocompatibility. More particularly, the invention relates to the design, synthesis, and uses of a hydrophilic (R)-miniPEG PNA unit having a polyethyleneglycol (miniPEG or "MP") sidechain at the .gamma.-carbon of the PNAs' backbone.

[0061] Some compounds described here can have asymmetric centers and therefore exist in different enantiomeric and diastereomeric forms. A compound of the invention can be in the form of an optical isomer or a diastereomer. Accordingly, the invention encompasses compounds of the invention and their uses as described herein in the form of their optical isomers, diastereoisomers and mixtures thereof, including a racemic mixture. Optical isomers of the compounds of the invention can be obtained by known techniques such as asymmetric synthesis, chiral chromatography, simulated moving bed technology or via chemical separation of stereoisomers through the employment of optically active resolving agents.

A stereomerically pure compound having two chiral centers will be substantially free of other diastereomers of the compound. A typical stereomerically pure compound comprises greater than about 80% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 20% by weight of other stereoisomers of the compound, for example greater than about 90% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 10% by weight of the other stereoisomers of the compound, or greater than about 95% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 5% by weight of the other stereoisomers of the compound, or greater than about 97% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 3% by weight of the other stereoisomers of the compound. 

[0063] If there is a discrepancy between a depicted structure and a name given to that structure, then the depicted structure controls. Additionally, if the stereochemistry of a structure or a portion of a structure is not indicated with, for example, bold or dashed lines, the structure or portion of the structure is to be interpreted as encompassing all stereoisomers of it. In some cases, however, where more than one chiral center exists, the structures and names may be represented as single enantiomers to help describe the relative stereochemistry. Those skilled in the art of organic synthesis will know if the compounds are prepared as single enantiomers from the methods used to prepare them.

[0071] While MP and larger molecular-weight polyethylene glycol (PEG) units have been incorporated into a number of macromolecular systems including, for example, peptides and proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, synthetic polymers, dendrimers, liposomes, and nanoparticles, the present inventors unexpectedly found that the introduction of a diethylene glycol group, commonly referred to as `miniPEG` or MP, in the backbone of PNA enhanced the aqueous solubility, biocompatibility and binding specificity along with reduction in aggregation and nonspecific binding of the PNA. 

[0072] The PNA backbone offers a choice of three sites (C-.alpha., C-.beta. and C-.gamma.), for introducing a miniPEG (MP) group. Previous studies by the present inventors have indicated that installation of a chiral center at position C-.gamma. within the PNA backbone induces helical organization (helicity) in the oligomer and provides a means for fine-tuning the thermodynamic stability of PNAs. The helical conformation adopted by an oligomer containing PNA monomers depends in part on the stereochemistry of the PNA monomers used. Two helical conformations are possible, namely, a right-handed conformation and a left-handed conformation. .gamma.PNAs prepared from L-amino acids adopt a right-handed helix, while those prepared from D-amino acids adopt a left-handed helix. However, bioanalytical studies indicate that only the right-handed helical .gamma.PNAs hybridize to DNA and RNA with high affinity and sequence selectivity. 

Synthesis 

[0073] A. General Synthetic Protocols 

[0074] Traditional routes for synthesizing PNAs have been tedious, involving the preparation of protected nucleobases--A, C, and G, and the use of toxic chemicals and multiple steps to obtain an orthogonally protected PNA monomer that can be used for synthesizing oligomers using a resin. As illustrated in Scheme 1, the present inventors have developed synthetic methodologies that do not require protection of nucleobases. Rather, PNA monomers according to Formula I are readily prepared using cheap, commercially available, unprotected nucleobases that are directly coupled to a Boc- or a Fmoc-protected .gamma.PNA backbone. 

##STR00015## 

[0075] Also provided is an efficient method for synthesizing the Boc-protected and/or Fmoc-protected PNA backbones. Compared to the traditional Mitsunobu synthetic route used in the preparation of PNA backbones, synthesis of PNA backbones according to the methods described herein is accomplished in a few simple steps from commercially available and relatively cheap Boc- and Fmoc-protected amino acids, for example, Boc or Fmoc protected alanine, threonine, cysteine, or serine according to the protocol (Scheme 2). As shown in this scheme, no elaborate column chromatography purification is necessary to obtain PNA backbones that have the required purity for coupling to unprotected nucleobases. 

##STR00016## 

[0076] The present invention also provides an optimized solid-phase reaction sequence for synthesizing PNA containing oligomers that is more efficient and reduces or eliminates a number of hazardous chemical transformation steps that routinely accompany traditional solid phase synthesis (Scheme 3). Synthetic methodologies described herein, have led to significant cost-reductions in the production of .gamma.PNA monomers and oligomers. 

[0077] The synthetic protocol illustrated in Scheme 3 is optimized to efficiently couple PNA monomers according to Formula I to a solid resin support with minimal side-reactions (less than 1%) or cross-coupling reactions between the unprotected, exocyclic amino groups of adenine, cytosine, or guanine nucleobase and the activated carboxyl group of a PNA monomer. Because solid phase synthesis according to the inventive protocol uses unprotected nucleobases no deprotection of the nucleobases in the final oligomer product are necessary prior to cleavage of the oligomer from the solid support. Additionally, pyridine neutralization and capping steps necessary for solid phase synthesis of DNA or RNA oligomers using conventional methods are omitted in the present method with no effect on the overall yield or purity of the final MP-.gamma.PNA oligomers. 

[0078] Bypassing these steps not only significantly reduces the synthesis time, but also reduces the costs of oligomer synthesis and costs associated with disposal of hazardous wastes, such as pyridine and acetic anhydride, omitted from the protocol shown in Scheme 3. 

##STR00017## 

[0079] Scheme 3 illustrates a solid phase synthesis for Formula I PNA monomers using Boc-protected (Scheme 3A) and Fmoc-protected PNA monomers (Scheme 3B). As stated above, one advantage of carrying out oligomer synthesis using a solid support is that it permits in situ neutralization of the ammonium ion generated by trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) cleavage of the Boc protecting group. According to the present inventors in situ neutralization is superior to the standard, pyridine wash/neutralization sequence used conventionally because it improves the overall yield and purity of MP-.gamma.PNA oligomers. 

[0080] Another advantage of the synthetic method according to the present invention is the use of a C-terminal thioester activated PNA monomer in coupling reactions. Traditional synthetic routes do not employ C-terminal thioester monomers for synthesis because of the ensuing intramolecular esterification and N-terminal truncation. In contrast, oligomer synthesis using a method according to the present invention does not suffer from these drawbacks. This is so because neutralization of the ammonium ion is carried out in situ and also due the greater rigidity of the .gamma.-modified PNA oligomers than their achiral counterparts. Enhanced oligomer rigidity disfavors intramolecular esterification and N-terminal truncation products. 

[0081] As stated above, the use of PNA monomers that have unprotected nucleobases during solid phase synthesis of an oligomer permits cleavage of the oligomer product from the resin support under mild conditions. According to one embodiment, the inventors have developed a novel allyl linker to connect the first PNA building block to the solid resin support. See Scheme 4A. The main advantage of the allyl linker is that it permits the release of the final oligomer from the solid support under near neutral conditions by treating the resin with palladium tetrakis triphenylphosphine (Pd(PPh.sub.3).sub.4) and stoichiometric amount of morpholine (Scheme 4B). 

##STR00018## 

[0082] PNA oligomers are important molecular tools in analytical assays and as therapeutic and diagnostic reagents for the treatment and detection of genetic diseases. Many diagnostic assays rely on sequence specific hybridization of the PNA oligomer to single stranded or duplex DNA or RNA. Other assays use a chemical probe covalently attached to the PNA oligomer to detect a biological macromolecule of interest. Both assay methods rely on the subsequent release of the PNA-DNA or PNA-RNA hybrid, or the release of the probe-biological macromolecule complex from the solid surface to permit their detection and quantitation. 

[0083] Reagents traditionally used to release the PNA complexes from the solid support, however, are harsh and unsuitable for use with many biological samples. The present inventors have addressed this problem by developing a novel allyl linker to attach PNA oligomers to a solid support so as to facilitate the gentle release of the PNA-biocomplex formed during the assay under near neutral conditions. 

[0084] B. Synthesis of Specific .gamma.PNA Monomers 

[0085] In one embodiment, Boc-protected .sup.R-MP.gamma.PNA monomers containing all four natural nucleobases (A, C, G, T) were synthesized according to the procedures outlined in Scheme 5. 

##STR00019## ##STR00020## 

[0086] Thus, alkylation of Boc-protected L-serine (1) with 1-bromo-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethane or 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethane methane sulfonate (2) was carried out as follows. To a vigorously stirred, chilled solution of DMF containing 2 equivalents of sodium hydride was slowly added compound (1), followed by addition of 1-bromo-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethane or or 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethane methane sulfonate (2). After stirring at 0.degree. C. for 1 hr, the mixture was quenched by addition of water at 0.degree. C. The solvents (DMF and water) were removed under reduced pressure at room temperature. Water was added to the crude mixture and the pH was adjusted to .about.3 using 5% HCl. The aqueous solution was extracted with ethyl acetate and dried over Na.sub.2SO.sub.4. The resultant product is pegylated Boc-protected serine, compound 3 which is obtained with high optical purity. 

[0087] Both the stoichiometry and order of addition of reagents were determined to be important for obtaining an optically pure product. Slow addition of Boc-serine is necessary to ensure complete deprotonation of the carboxyl group prior to removal of the hydroxyl proton. Formation of the carboxylate anion reduces the acidity of the .alpha.-proton making it less susceptible to deprotonation by base. 

[0088] Esterification of the alkylated product (3) followed by reduction with sodium borohydride yields the corresponding alcohol, serinol (4). The conversion of the carboxylic acid moiety to an alcohol renders the Ca-proton inert to deprotonation and racemization in subsequent reaction steps. The serinol (4) was allowed to react with sodium iodide in the presence of zirconium (IV) chloride (ZrCl.sub.4) as a catalyst to obtain the corresponding iodide (5). Subsequent displacement of the iodide by ethyl glycinate yielded the PNA backbone (6). 

[0089] Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) mediated coupling of 6 with the appropriate carboxymethylnucleobases (A, C, G, and T), followed by hydrolysis of the resulting ester group gave the desired Formula I .gamma.PNA monomers (8a-d). 

[0090] The optical purities of key intermediates and final .gamma.PNA monomers according to Formula I were determined by .sup.19F-NMR following chemical derivatization as described in the literature. See Seco et al., Chem. Rev. 2004, 104, 17-117. Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometric detection (GC/MS) has been described in the literature to determine the enantiomeric excess (ee) of chiral .alpha.-PNA monomers and their oligomers. See Corradini et al., Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 1999, 10, 2063-2066. 

[0091] The present inventors found .sup.19F-NMR to be a convenient and accurate alternative method for determining the ee values for Formula I .gamma.PNA monomers and synthetic intermediates of .gamma.PNA monomers. Analysis by .sup.19F-NMR required removal of the Boc-protecting group and subsequent coupling of the free amine group of a Formula I .gamma.PNA monomer a synthetic intermediate of .gamma.PNA monomer with (+)-1-methoxy-1-(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetyl chloride (MTPA-Cl, Mosher's reagent). 

[0092] Boc-D-serine was used as the starting reagent to synthesize the corresponding PNA stereoisomer (.sup.S-MP.gamma.PNA monomer), which is required as a control to quantify the enantiomeric excess of the desired of .sup.R-MP.gamma.PNA monomer. Inspection of the .sup.19F-NMR spectral trace for MTPA derivatized .sup.R-MP.gamma.PNA monomer and .sup.S-MP.gamma.PNA monomer revealed no traces of the .sup.S-MP.gamma.PNA monomer indicating that the desired Formula I compound is optically pure. Based on the spectral data it was concluded that the desired Formula I PNA monomer had an optical purity of 99% ee, within the detection limit of .sup.19F-NMR. 

[0093] While thymine .sup.R-MP.gamma.PNA monomer showed two peaks for rotamers at -68.80 and -68.95 ppm in the NMR spectrum, the corresponding thymine .sup.S-MP.gamma.PNA showed only one rotamer. The existence of the two rotamers for thymine .sup.R-MP.gamma.PNA monomer is unclear. 

[0094] .gamma.PNA monomers manufactured according to synthetic protocols described above have enantiomeric purity of at least 90% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 10% by weight of the other stereoisomer of the compound, or greater than about 95% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 5% by weight of the other stereoisomer of the compound, or greater than about 97% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 3% by weight of the other stereoisomer of the compound or greater than or equal to about 99% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than or equal to about 1% by weight of the other stereoisomer respectively. 

[0095] .sup.R-MP.gamma.PNA monomers based on the L-alanine scaffold were synthesized as described by Rapireddy et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007, 129, 15596-15600 and He et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009, 131, 12088-12090. 

[0096] While L-alanine-derived .gamma.PNA (.sup.S-Ala.gamma.PNA) oligomers are able to invade mixed-sequence double helical B-form DNA (B-DNA) and are promising as antisense and antigene reagents, the .sup.S-Ala.gamma.PNAs are poorly soluble in water and have a tendency to aggregate, presumably due to the charge-neutral backbone and hydrophobic character of the .gamma.-Me. According to one embodiment, therefore, the replacement of the side chain methyl group with miniPEG, for example, an ethylene glycol unit [(OCH.sub.2CH.sub.2).sub.n, where n=1-10] at C-.gamma. results in a (R)miniPEG PNA monomer according to Formula I. Introducing the (R)miniPEG PNA monomer into a oligomer chain induces a right-handed helix in the resultant PNA oligomer. Such oligomers have improved water solubility and reduced aggregation while retaining superior hybridization properties.

[0097] To evaluate whether a PNA oligomer containing one or more .gamma.PNA monomers according to Formula I influence the conformation and hybridization properties of PNA oligomer or influence the water solubility and aggregation properties of a PNA oligomer, the present inventors synthesized PNA oligomers whose sequences are shown in Table 1 below.

X = fluorescein (FITC), Y = tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA). 

[0098] The first set of oligomers (PNA1 through 5), were designed to test the effects of miniPEG on the conformation and hybridization properties of PNA. The second set of oligomers (PNA6 through 10), was designed to test the effect of miniPEG on water solubility. A hexadecameric sequence is chosen for the aqueous solubility study because such a sequence represents a statistical length that would be required to target a unique site within the mammalian genome or transcriptome. The third set included two oligomers (PNA1 and 4). Each oligomer in this set was designed to test the effect of miniPEG on self-aggregation tendency of PNA containing oligomers using Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). Thus, PAN's 1 and 4 were separately linked to fluorescein (FITC) at the N-terminus (PNA1X and PNA4X) and tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) group at the C-terminus (PNA1Y and PNA4) of each oligomer. A lysine residue was introduced at the C-terminus to improves water-solubility and aid in the purification and characterization of the labeled oligomerss. 

[0099] All PNA oligomers, those with and without MP side-chains, are synthesized on solid-support according to the protocols described herein or published in the literature. Unlike PNA's with modifications made at the .alpha.-backbone that require further optimization of the solid phase resin reaction coupling conditions in order to minimize racemization, no precautions or modification of the synthetic protocol are necessary for coupling of the inventive Formula I .sup.R-MP.gamma.PNA monomers on the resin. 

[0100] Moreover, after coupling the last monomer the resultant oligomer can be readily cleaved from the resin and precipitated with ethyl ether. The air-dried pellets of the crude oligomers are dissolved in water/acetonitrile mixture (80/20), and purified by reverse-phase HPLC and characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. 

[0101] 1. Effect of MiniPEG of Oligomer Conformation & Hybridization 

[0102] PNA1 through 5 oligomers were analyzed by CD spectroscopy to determine the effect of minPEG on the conformation of PNA oligomers. Consistent with the earlier findings (Dragulescu-Andrasi, A. et al.; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 10258-10267), no CD signals were observed within the nucleobase absorption regions for PNA1 that does not contain a Formula I R-MP-.gamma.PNA group. See FIG. 1A. This observation indicates that this PNA oligomer either (i) does not adopt a helical conformation, or (ii) has an equal proportion of a right-handed and left-handed helix in the analytical sample. 

[0103] However, PNA2 through 5 show distinct exciton coupling patterns in the CD spectrum with two distinct minima's at 242 and 280 nm and two maxima's at 220 and 260 nm. The observed CD pattern is characteristic of a right-handed helix. See FIG. 3B. The addition of miniPEG units did not alter the amplitude of the CD signals. However, the addition of miniPEG does alter the wavelengths of maxima and minima, shifting it towards that of the PNA-DNA and PNA-RNA double helices (FIG. 3B). 

[0104] Moreover, a gradual dip at the 242 nm minimum generally indicates a tightening in the helical pitch of the oligomer from one that resembles that of a PNA-PNA duplex with 18 base-pairs per turn to one that resembles that of a PNA-DNA duplex with 13 base-pairs per turn. Overall, the CD profiles of PNA2 through 5 are similar to those of the corresponding PNA-DNA and PNA-RNA hybrid duplexes (FIG. 3B), the major difference in the CD trace being the amplitude which is roughly doubled for the duplex as compared to individual PNA strand. 

[0105] Without ascribing to a particular theory, this doubling of amplitude is likely due to the higher concentration of bases in the hybrid duplex (approximately twice the concentration), than that of the individual PNA strand. Taken together, these results show that a single, (R)-MP unit installed at the .gamma.-backbone is sufficient to preorganize PNA into a right-handed helix. 

[0106] While incorporation of additional miniPEG units does not further improve base-stacking, as is apparent from the similarities in the CD amplitudes, the presence of additional miniPEG's does help to tighten the helical pitch of the oligomers making them more rigid and compact. This is apparent from the temperature-dependent CD measurements, which showed a less dramatic reduction in the signal amplitude as a function of temperature change for the PNAS oligomer consisting of ten R-MP-.gamma.PNA groups as compared to the PNA2 oligomer having a single R-MP-.gamma.PNA group (FIG. 4). Even at a temperature as high as 80.degree. C., a distinct CD profile is obtained for PNAS, indicating that base-stacking is occurring for this oligomer at a temperature of 80.degree. C. In contrast, PNA2 is completely denatured at this temperature. 

[0107] Thus, the overall stability of the oligomers increases linearly with the number of MP units incorporated (FIG. 1B). The fact that PNA5 adopts a helical conformation most closely resembling that of a PNA-DNA or a PNA-RNA duplex suggests that it can hybridize to DNA and RNA more effectively than the other oligomers in this series. 

[0108] 2. Effect of MiniPEG on Thermal Stability of Oligomers 

[0109] UV-melting experiments were performed to determine the effect of MP on the thermal stability of PNA oligomers following hybridization to DNA or an RNA. FIG. 3A illustrates that the incorporation of a single miniPEG side-chain stabilized a PNA-DNA duplex by 4.degree. C. The extent of thermal stabilization gradually increased with additional minPEG units. However, increase in thermal stability tapers off to a value of about 2.3.degree. C. per unit for the fully-modified oligomer, that is an oligomer made up of R-MP-.gamma.PNA groups only (e.g., PNA5). 

[0110] A similar pattern is observed for a R-MP-.gamma.PNA-RNA duplex, but the observed increase in thermal stability is lower for a R-MP-.gamma.PNA-RNA duplex as compared to a R-MP-.gamma.PNA-DNA duplex (FIG. 3B). The enhancement in thermal stability of a R-MP-.gamma.PNA-RNA duplex is only 3.degree. C. for the first R-MP-.gamma.PNA-monomer that is incorporated into the PNA oligomer and this gain in thermal stability reduces to about 1.2.degree. C. per R-MP-.gamma.PNA monomer for an oligomer made entirely R-MP-.gamma.PNA (PNA5). In contrast the gain in thermal stability is about 2.3.degree. C./unit for R-MP-.gamma.PNA-DNA duplexes. 

[0111] It was further observed that while unmodified PNA1 binds more tightly to RNA than to DNA (differential T.sub.m (.DELTA.T.sub.m) of 10.degree. C.), the fully-modified miniPEG PNA5 displayed identical thermal stability with both RNA as well as with DNA. The apparent lack for preferential binding shown by PNA5 is not clearly understood but it may be due to rigidity of the PNA5 oligomer's backbone. 

[0112] Without being bound to a particular theory, the present inventors believe that because PNA5 is more rigid and tightly wound when compared to PNA1 the rigid backbone limits conformational freedom necessary to accommodate the DNA and/or RNA template strands. Under such circumstances, the DNA and RNA strands taking part in hybridization themselves are forced to undergo a conformational change necessary to accommodate the .sup.R-MP.gamma.PNA helix. The above hypothesis provides an explanation why an .sup.S-Ala.gamma.PNA-DNA prefers a P-form helix, a helical structure that is intermediate between the A- and B-form DNA. It is also clear that the hybridization of a .sup.R-MP.gamma.PNA to DNA and RNA requires the DNA and RNA moieties to conformationally alter to accommodate .gamma.PNA exigencies rather than the other way around. 

[0113] Because the RNA strand is less accommodating to conformational changes, its hybridization to a fully modified .sup.R-MP.gamma.PNA oligomer is less facile than hybridization of a DNA to the fully modified .sup.R-MP.gamma.PNA oligomer. 

[0114] Further insights related to the contribution of miniPEG to the stability of the PNA-DNA duplex was obtained from van't Hoff analysis. Data in Table 2 show the thermodynamic parameters associated with hybridization of PNA1 through 5 to a complementary DNA or RNA strand.

Temperature = 298 K. 

[0115] The results show that the Gibbs binding free energy (.DELTA.G.degree.) increases approximately linearly with increase in the number of miniPEG units for PNA-DNA duplexes, while increase in .DELTA.G.degree. is sigmoidal for PNA-RNA duplexes (FIGS. 3A and 3B). 

[0116] The incorporation of a single miniPEG unit results in a net gain in binding free energy of about 5 kJ/mol for the PNA-DNA duplex and is less than 5 KJ/mol for a PNA-RNA duplex. The gain in binding free energy, moreover, is not linearly correlated to the number of .sup.R-MP.gamma.PNA monomers in the PNA oligomer. Rather, most of the net gain in binding free energy is from the first two .sup.R-MP.gamma.PNA monomers and decreases as more .sup.R-MP.gamma.PNA monomers are introduced in the PNA oligomer of the PNA-RNA duplex. Additionally, a reduction in the equilibrium dissociation constant (K.sub.d) by nearly five orders of magnitude was observed for a PNA5-DNA duplex while a decrease of about three orders of magnitude is observed for PNA5-RNA as compared to the PNA1-DNA and PNA1-RNA duplexes. 

[0117] The binding free energy gain is believed to predominantly be from enthalpic contributions for both PNA-DNA and PNA-RNA duplexes as is shown by the gradual increase in the .DELTA.H.degree. term with the number of minPEG units present in the PNA. Further support that the gain in binding free energy is predominantly from enthalpic contributions stems from the observation that single-stranded PNA's adopt a compact globular form, presumably to minimize exposure of the hydrophobic core of nucleobases and the charge-neutral backbone to the aqueous solvent. It follows, therefore, that an enthalpic penalty would be incurred for unfolding the collapsed (globular) PNA in order to adopt the helical structure needed to participate in hybridization to a complementary DNA or RNA. Removal of this penalty by inducing a helical structure through the use of the miniPEG modified .gamma.-PNA according to Formula I would translate to a more favorable enthalpic change during hybridization. See Table 2. 

[0118] According to the present inventors, an additional enthalpic benefit of the modified backbone may be arise due to the formation of a network of structured water molecules that bridge the backbone amide protons to the adjacent nucleobases, stabilizing interactions that are more pertinent in a .gamma.PNA-DNA duplex than in a traditional PNA-DNA or PNA-PNA duplexes. 

[0119] Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis is used to study the hybridization kinetics of .sup.R-MP.gamma.PNA-DNA and .sup.R-MP.gamma.PNA-RNA duplexes. Briefly, SPR was performed as follows. According to one embodiment, the PNA probe was immobilized to the chip while the DNA target was captured from solution. In another embodiment, a biotinylated version of the DNA target is immobilized on a streptavidin-conjugated, carboxymethylated dextran chip at a relatively low surface density (ca. 100 response units) of DNA targets to limit mass transport effects on the association kinetics. Solutions containing 10-50 nM PNA oligomers are allowed to flow over the chip for about 420 seconds, at which point the flow is switched to a PNA-free buffer to allow net dissociation of the hybridized PNA. 

[0120] Individual sensorgrams for the unmodified (PNA1) and .sup.R-MP.gamma.-modified (PNA2 through 5) oligomers at 30 nM concentration are shown in FIG. 6. While small variations are observed in the association kinetics, singly modified PNA2 appears to bind approximately twice as fast as the unmodified PNA. Fitting the data to a 1:1 binding model yields association rate constants (k.sub.a) that range from 4.7.times.10.sup.5M.sup.-1s.sup.-1 to 9.7.times.10.sup.5M.sup.-1s.sup.-1 (Table 3).

Indicates uncertainty due to the calculated value approaching the limits of detection of the instrument. 

[0121] In contrast, significantly greater variability was seen in the dissociation phase of the experiment, with the dissociation rate constant (k.sub.d) varying by at least a factor of 50. Equilibrium dissociation constants (K.sub.d) calculated from the ratio of the dissociation and association rate constants are also given in Table 3. Unmodified PNA1 and fully-modified PNAS have K.sub.d=2.8 nM and 54 pM, respectively. The K.sub.d values for PNA1-3 determined by SPR (Table 3) are similar to those determined by UV melting experiments (Table 2). However, increasing divergences are observed for PNA4 and PNAS, with the SPR-derived values being 12- and 1200-fold greater, respectively than the K.sub.d values determined by UV melting experiments (Table 2). 

[0122] This differences are attributed to the very small degrees of dissociation observed within the timescale of the SPR experiment. However these small differences in the degree of dissociation introduce a large uncertainty during the dissociation of the duplex and give rise to the differences in K.sub.d values. 

[0123] In the above example, SPR results clearly demonstrate that enhanced affinity of the .sup.R-MP.gamma.PNAs are due to the significantly slower dissociation kinetics of PNA oligomers containing one or more of the .sup.R-MP.gamma.PNA monomers. Thus, the helical preorganization of the modified PNA may have a smaller contribution to faster hybridization kinetics than previously proposed. That is, hybridization is likely to require some structural reorganization of the complementary DNA strand, negating to some extent the benefit of pre-organizing the PNA oligomer to helical form. 

[0124] CD, NMR, and X-ray data have shown that .gamma.PNAs derived from L-amino acids adopt a right-handed helix, and that the helix becomes more rigid as more .gamma.-chiral units are added in the backbone. One would therefore expect a fully-modified PNA5 to hybridize to DNA and RNA targets with greater sequence selectivity than PNA1. To verify this hypothesis, thermal stabilities of PNA5-DNA and PNA5-RNA duplexes containing perfectly-matched (PM) and single-base mismatched (MM) targets were determined and compared to those from an earlier study with PNA1-DNA and PNA1-RNA duplexes. The results show that despite the strong binding affinity, PNA5 is able to discriminate between closely related sequences. The .DELTA.Tm ranges from -17 to -21.degree. C. for PNA5-DNA and -16 to -20.degree. C. for PNA5-RNA containing a single-base mismatch (X=C, G, T), as compared to -10 to -14.degree. C. for PNA1-DNA and -11 to -18.degree. C. for PNA1-RNA duplex (Table 4). The level of sequence discrimination is greater for PNA5-DNA than for PNA1-DNA, and similar, if not slightly better, for PNA5-RNA as compared to PNA1-RNA. This result is consistent with PNA5 adopting a more rigid helical motif, which is less accommodating to structural mismatches as compared to PNA1.

[0125] Effect of MiniPEG on Aqueous Solubility and Aggregation 

[0126] To determine whether inclusion of miniPEG in the backbone of a Formula I PNA has an effect on water solubility of the resultant oligomer, saturating concentrations of PNA6 through 10 (Table 1) were prepared in water and the concentrations of each solution was measured by UV-spectroscopy. The incorporation of a single MP unit enhances the solubility of PNA6 by nearly 2-fold (Table 5). The solubility of the oligomers is further improved, albeit to a smaller extent, with additional MP units. 

TABLE-US-00006 TABLE 5 Saturated concentrations of PNA oligomers # MP Sat. conc. Oligomer units (mM) PNA6 0 39 PNA7 1 76 PNA8 3 108 PNA9 5 350 PNA10 8 >500 

[0127] FRET was used to study whether incorporation of a miniPEG unit in the backbone of PNA can help reduce aggregation. Different concentrations of unmodified PNA1X/PNA1Y and homologous .gamma.-modified PNA4X/PNA4Y pairs (Table 1) are prepared by mixing equimolar ratios of the individual oligomers in sodium phosphate buffer. The samples were excited at 475 nm, the .lamda..sub.max of FITC, and emission was recorded from 480 to 700 nm. Upon aggregation, in which the oligomers bearing FITC and TAMRA come into contact with one another, excitation at 475 nm leads to energy transfer from FITC to TAMRA because of the proximity of the two chromophores. Comparison of the FRET efficiencies of the two systems at different concentrations, therefore, can provide an assessment of the effect of miniPEG on intermolecular interaction of PNA's. 

[0128] As illustrated by FIG. 5A, when the concentration for each unmodified PNA oligomer is as low as 1 .mu.M, a small but noticeable emission appeared at 580 nm, indicating some aggregation between PNA1X and PNA1Y. The extent of aggregation is further intensified with increasing concentrations of oligomers, apparent from the fluorescent intensity of TAMRA at .about.580 nm upon excitation of the FITC donor at 475 nm. 

[0129] In contrast, at a concentration of 20 .mu.M, the point at which nearly 70% FRET efficiency is observed for unmodified PNA1X/PNA1Y pair, about 5% FRET efficiency is observed for the .gamma.-modified PNA4X/PNA4Y pair (FIG. 7B). These results indicate that the .gamma.-modified PNA pair does not interact with each other as much as the unmodified PNAs. The distinction is also apparent from photographs of the samples illuminated using a short-wavelength (254 nm), hand-held UV-lamp. The PNA1X/PNA1Y solution displayed a light orange emission at room temperature and yellow-green hue at 90.degree. C., an indication of the aggregate dissociating upon heating. In contrast, the PNA4X/PNA4Y solution displayed the same color, yellow-green, at room temperature as well as at 90.degree. C., indicating that the oligomers are well dispersed even at room temperature. Thus, the R-MP-.gamma.-modification imparts not only enhanced solubility to PNA, but also suppresses aggregation. 

[0130] It has been documented that at moderate concentrations, PNA tends to aggregate and stick to surfaces and other macromolecules in a nonspecific manner. Such interactions can lead to off-target binding and cytotoxic effects, when employed in the cellular context. Among the macromolecules that PNA is known to interact nonspecifically with are nucleic acids and proteins. 

[0131] To assess the extent of off-target binding of PNA and .sup.R-MP.gamma.PNA, a gel-shift assay is performed. In this case, a DNA fragment, 171 bp in length, is incubated with different concentrations of PNA6 and PNA10 (Table 1) in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer at 37.degree. C. for 16 hr. The two oligomers contain identical nucleobase sequence but differ from another at the .gamma.-backbone. PNA6 is unmodified, whereas PNA10 is modified at every other position with R-MP-.gamma. side-chain. Following incubation, the samples are separated on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and stained with SYBR-Gold. 

[0132] Since the target does not contain a complementary sequence to the oligomers, no binding is expected to take place, in which case the intensity of the DNA band should remain fairly constant, independent of the PNA6 and PNA10 concentrations. Instead, a drastic reduction in the intensity of the DNA band is observed with increasing concentrations of PNA6 (FIG. 6). At 10 .mu.M (corresponding to a PNA/DNA ratio of 25:1) or higher, the DNA band completely disappeared from the gel. 

[0133] In contrast, for .gamma.-modified PNA10 the intensity of the DNA bands remained fairly constant even at a concentration as high as 20 .mu.M (PNA/DNA ratio of 50:1). This result is consistent with the solubility and FRET data, indicating that incorporation of miniPEG at the .gamma.-backbone not only improves the hybridization properties and water solubility of PNA but also helps to reduce nonspecific binding with other macromolecules as well. 

[0134] Gamma-backbone modified PNA's according to Formula I as well as oligomers containing the Formula I PNA's are provided, in accordance with the invention, to improve design and utility of PNA-based therapeutic and diagnostics. For instance, improvements in hybridization properties can enable R-MP.gamma.PNAs to invade double helical DNA and structured RNA that may not be permissible with other oligonucleotide mimics. Enhancements in water solubility will facilitate the handling and processing of PNA while lessening the concerns for nonspecific binding and cytotoxic effects. Improvements in these areas, along with the flexibility of synthesis whereby other chemical functionalities can be installed at the .gamma.-backbone with ease, will expand the utility of PNA into other scientific disciplines, including drug discovery and nanotechnology.
