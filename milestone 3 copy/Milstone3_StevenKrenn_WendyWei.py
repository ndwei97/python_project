# This tool allows user to input a txt file and extract keywords out of it and then output it in an html file.
# Before extracting the keywords, this tool first performs text analysis using the delete junk words and substituting miss-spelling words.
# Then it pull out a list of keywords and order them so the most frequent word appears first.
# Finally, this tool output all the keywords into an html file.
